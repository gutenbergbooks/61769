<h2 class="xx-large">The Thirteenth Hussars in the
Great War.</h2>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="large">INTRODUCTORY.</span></h2>

<p>The main object of this book is to give an account of the services
rendered by the Thirteenth Hussars during the last ten years,
especially in the war which has just come to an end.</p>

<p>The earlier history of the Regiment has already been written,
and very fully written. On this subject the standard authority must
always be Barrett’s valuable work, which takes up the story from
the beginning and carries it on to 1910, a period of nearly two
hundred years. In order that readers of the present narrative may
start with a general knowledge of the Regiment and its past, a
chapter relating to this period has been introduced. As will be seen,
it touches upon most of the wars waged by Great Britain since the
days of Marlborough. But it is a mere summary, chiefly drawn from
Barrett, and contains little new matter.</p>

<p>In ordinary circumstances this summary would open the book,
but any account of the part played by a British Cavalry regiment
in the late war must of necessity have some bearing upon the larger
question of the part likely to be played by the mounted arm in any
wars of the future; and just now this question is of special interest,
for it has been freely asserted that recent changes in military
conditions, notably the vast increase in the size of armies and the
development of the aeroplane, have made Cavalry an obsolete and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
useless arm; and it is important for us to know whether they have
done so, or are likely to do so. Therefore it has been thought
desirable to give at the beginning a brief review of the history of
Cavalry before this war, and at the close a few remarks upon the
lessons of the war with regard to the value of the arm under present
conditions.</p>

<p>Perhaps the services of the Thirteenth Hussars will not lose in
interest if considered to some exten/spat from this point of view.

<span class="large">CAVALRY BEFORE THE GREAT WAR.</span></h2>

<p>For thousands of years the horse has been the companion of man
in war.</p>

<p>It is significant that when Job gives us his wonderful description
of the strong things of earth and sea and air, he speaks of the horse
in this connection, as rejoicing in the sound of the trumpet, and
smelling the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the
shouting. “He goeth out to meet the armed men. He mocketh
at fear, and is not dismayed; neither turneth he back from the
sword. The quiver rattleth against him, the flashing spear and the
javelin. He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage.” And
in many passages of the Bible, in poetry and in narrative, we have
mention of the chariot and the horseman.</p>

<p>Representations of them are to be found in the carvings and
tablets of long-vanished dynasties and nations. To take a single
instance, they are shown in Assyrian carvings dating nearly a
thousand years before Christ, which can be seen now in the British
Museum.</p>

<p>Apparently the chariot came into the field earlier than the horseman
usually so called, and the first use of the horse in war was to
take up to the front in chariots warriors who got down to fight on
foot, as the Greek chiefs did in the siege of Troy. But ere long
Scythians or other nomads learned to mount the horse himself,
and then began that close conjunction and sympathy between man
and horse which made the two almost one creature, the Centaur of
the fable.</p>

<p>The subject has been touched by many writers. There is perhaps
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
no need to consider here the uses and gradual disappearance of the
war-chariot. For present purposes it is sufficient to note that long
before the historical age the armed hosts of the great Eastern
Empires were composed in part of mounted men, who marched,
and often fought, on horseback. The chariots and the people
attached to them may have been the first “Cavalry”; but the
word as used in this book refers to mounted men only&mdash;riders,&mdash;and
riders who did some part at least of their fighting from the
backs of horses.</p>

<p>If the use of mounted men in war began in the East, to which
Western nations owe so much, including even their religion, it soon
extended to Europe. In the first conflict between East and West
on a large scale of which we have any real knowledge, nearly five
hundred years before Christ, the Persian invaders of Greece found
that the Greeks had little Cavalry to oppose to the thousands of
horsemen whom they brought with them. The men of Athens and
Sparta fought on foot at Marathon and Thermopyl&aelig;. Even at
Mount Cith&aelig;ron, where Masistius in his golden cuirass charged and
died, the Greek army was an army of footmen. Nevertheless there
were some horsemen in Greece even then, especially on the plains
of Thessaly; and the frieze of the Parthenon, of not much later date,
shows helmeted Greek soldiers riding spirited horses. The horses
are small, apparently not more than thirteen or at most fourteen
hands, and are ridden barebacked, but they are evidently war horses.
Then we have Xenophon’s well-known treatise on Cavalry, a
thoroughly practical work, which must have been written in the first
half of the next century; and after that the organisation of the Greek
Cavalry is fairly well known.</p>

<p>It was Alexander the Great who first showed what horsemen
could do in war if properly trained and led. Until his time Cavalry
seem to have fought mostly in loose swarms, rather as skirmishers
and bowmen than as solid squadrons using the weight of the horse
itself to overthrow and destroy bodies of footmen. He saw the value
of “shock tactics,” and taught his Cavalry to use them, so that
when he invaded Persia in 334 <small>B.C.</small> the famous horsemen of Persia
went down again and again before his fiery onsets. They had
themselves, according to Herodotus, some notion of charging in
squadron on the battlefield, but they had never seen Cavalry
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
used in mass, and neither they nor the Persian foot could stand
against it.</p>

<p>In the impetuous rapidity of all his movements, especially
perhaps in the closeness and vigour of his pursuits, Alexander was
in fact a model leader of horse, and his conquests were largely due
to his Cavalry, which he not only wielded with dash and power
against the Cavalry of the enemy, but kept thoroughly in hand
even after a successful charge, and threw into the scale wherever
they might be most required to help his foot soldiers.</p>

<p>Ever since those days, for more than twenty centuries, the
history of war on land has been the history of a struggle for pre-eminence
between horsemen and footmen. The rivalry has been
complicated by the invention of Artillery, and of late years by the
development of fighting in the air; but it has gone on unceasingly,
and can hardly be said to have come to an end even now. In the
course of it there has often been a tendency to lose sight of the
fact that combined effort for one purpose by all arms, and not
rivalry between them, is the secret of success in war. But the
long dispute and its vicissitudes form an interesting study.</p>

<p>By the Romans the effective use of Cavalry was for a long
time not well understood. Though they had their “Equites” from
early days, they got to rely more and more for serious fighting
upon their wonderful legions, and it was not until the Punic Wars
that they learned their lesson. Hannibal, like Alexander, was a
born leader of horse, and when a hundred years after Alexander’s
death he invaded Italy by way of the Alps, he at once taught
Western Europe what Alexander had taught the Greeks and
Persians, that in the existing condition of military armament,
Cavalry well trained and boldly used in masses could do great
things on the battlefield. The successive victories which he gained
in Italy, with very inferior numbers, over the proud and confident
troops of Rome, were due in large measure to his skilful use of his
horsemen. At Cann&aelig;, for example, his wild Numidian light horse,
riding without saddle or reins, and his heavier squadrons from
Spain and the North, began by driving off the weak Roman Cavalry
opposed to them, and then, wheeling inwards upon the rear of the
advancing legions, enclosed them in a circle of steel from which
there was no escape. Fifty thousand of them are said to have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
fallen, and for a time Rome seemed to be, perhaps really was, at
his mercy. Every one knows the story of his long struggle against
hopeless odds, and of his final defeat. When at last he was conquered
the superiority in horsemen had passed to the Romans, and
he was overwhelmed and crushed by his own methods. He had
taught his enemies to fight.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p>As time went on they forgot in a measure the lesson they had
learnt from him, and they suffered some heavy reverses in consequence&mdash;for
example, in their wars with the Parthians which
stopped their expansion eastward; but happily such enemies were
rare, and gradually the legions won for Rome the empire of the
Western world. It lasted as long as the spirit and discipline of
their incomparable Infantry remained unimpaired.</p>

<p>In the closing centuries of Imperial Rome the bulk of her
enemies marched against her on horseback, and her own armies
came to be composed more and more of Cavalry. Her last great
battle was against Attila the Hun, whose people lived on their
horses. It was a victory; but it was a Cavalry victory, and won
by the help of the Goths. Her Infantry had long since failed
her, and the Imperial City had been herself in the hands of the
Barbarians. Her fall had been due to the woeful corruption and
degeneration of the legions, not to any inherent superiority of the
horseman over the footman; but the fact remains that at this time
Cavalry was everywhere regarded as the more important arm of
the two.</p>

<p>There followed a long period during which the predominance of
the horseman grew more and more undisputed. With the collapse
of Rome scientific warfare on a large scale became a lost art, and
in the disorderly welter of the Dark Ages the fighting power of the
footman, which depends so much upon organisation and discipline,
sank lower and lower. To deal it a final blow came, a thousand
years or so after Christ, the institution of Chivalry, which to a
considerable extent undermined national feeling and exalted in its
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
place the individual prowess of the Knight. Having its origin in
a praiseworthy attempt to set up a higher standard of right and
wrong, to resist cruelty and injustice, to honour woman as she
should be honoured, and to make courage and courtesy the aim
of men, it did much good, and has left to succeeding ages some
noble aspirations and examples. Even now there is surely no
better thing one can say of a man than that he is chivalrous&mdash;<i>chevaleresque</i>&mdash;like
a knight of old. The horseman had given his
name to a new social order and a splendid ideal. In practice
Chivalry was not always what it should have been, but the glamour
of it lies upon all our poetry and literature. Even the free-lance or
the moss-trooper, unprincipled ruffian as he often was, remains to
our eyes a picturesque figure. There is still a gleam on his helmet
and spear that time cannot take away. The war-horse and his
rider had reached in those days the climax of their power and
reputation.</p>

<p>Then, very gradually, came a change in the opposite direction.
The knights and their retainers had been practically the only fighting
men who counted, and were accustomed to ride down with
ease and contempt any footmen who ventured to stand against
them. Bows and arrows and axes and knives seemed of little
avail against the spearman with his almost impenetrable armour
and his thundering steed. As Colonel Maude puts it, “the knight
in full armour had borne about the same relation to the infantry
as an ironclad nowadays bears to a fleet of Chinese junks.” But
little by little it began to be recognised, first it is said in the
Crusades, when the knights had to take or defend fortresses and
otherwise fight on foot, that there were operations in war for
which the heavily armoured horseman was not well fitted. Bodies
of footmen began to be raised again for such purposes, and even
to be brought into the open field as archers or cross-bowmen for
use in broken ground. They often suffered horribly, but now and
then they gained some successes, and as time went on they
developed greater skill and confidence. Eventually, at Cr&eacute;cy and
Poictiers and Agincourt, the English archers, with their cloth-yard
shafts and their bristling defence of pointed stakes, won astonishing
victories over the Chivalry of France, and proved to Europe
that the horseman was no longer invincible on the battlefield. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
lesson had very nearly been taught by the English three hundred
years earlier, on the field of Hastings; but the time had not then
come. Lured from their stockades, the footmen had been cut to
pieces, and the French Cavalry had conquered England. At Cr&eacute;cy
the English footmen turned the tables. And elsewhere, about the
same period, the Swiss Infantry won almost equal honour.</p>

<p>The Cavalry of Europe nevertheless fought hard for their old
pre-eminence, and it was long before they could be brought to see
that they would never again be the undisputed masters in battle.
But it was a lesson they had to learn. As time went on they found
their charges repelled by serried squares of pikemen, from which
came showers of arrows and cross-bolts; and later the invention of
firearms weighted the scale still further against them. The only
offensive weapons of the horsemen were the weight of their horses
and the lance or sword; and if the horses failed to break the rows
of eighteen-foot pikes, the <i>arme blanche</i> could do nothing. At
last, after many attempts by the Cavalry to meet these new
conditions, by using firearms themselves and other devices, it came
to be generally recognised that against confident and steady infantry
armed with the pike, deliberate frontal assault by horsemen was
practically hopeless, and that for the future Cavalry must depend to
some extent upon surprise and stratagem to give them victory. The
defence had in some measure triumphed over the attack, and the
essentially offensive arm had lost its pride of place.</p>

<p>This is not to say that for the future Cavalry was to be useless
on the battlefield&mdash;far from it. The range of the unwieldy arquebus,
or of the smooth-bore musket which followed it, was not so great as
to keep Cavalry out of striking distance; and their speed, if they
were led with decision and dash, would yet give them many opportunities
of riding down the footmen. They could no longer do so
whenever they pleased, but they were still a formidable part of the
fighting line.</p>

<p>This was shown very clearly in our own Civil War. The armies
of both King and Parliament were largely composed of horsemen,
and in fight after fight it was they who were most conspicuous.
Finally, the emergence of a great leader of Cavalry turned the scale
in favour of the Roundheads. Cromwell’s Ironsides, thoroughly
trained, and used as in old days the Cavalry of Alexander and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
Hannibal had been used, not only with dash but with coolness and
self-control, proved too strong for the Royalists, cavaliers though they
were. Unlike Prince Rupert, Cromwell kept his horsemen firmly in
hand, throwing them into the fight wherever they were most required,
and the result was to make him master of England.</p>

<p>On the Continent too Cavalry was still largely used in battle.
The Turkish horsemen were numerous and formidable. Before our
civil conflicts, in the Thirty Years’ War, Gustavus Adolphus had
wielded Cavalry with much effect, and while Cromwell was fighting
in England the great Cond&eacute; had sprung into fame by the achievement
of his horsemen at Rocroy. Under him and other commanders the
French Cavalry gained an enduring reputation, and the same may
be said for the Germans under Pappenheim and Montecuculi. The
Infantry was now perhaps the leading arm in battle, and it was
growing stronger as its firearm improved, while the rise of a more
or less effective Artillery was adding to the difficulties of the Cavalry
attack; but at the close of the seventeenth century the horseman
was still a power in the field.</p>

<p>Throughout the first half of the eighteenth century this state of
things continued. In Marlborough’s wars Cavalry was used in large
numbers, and with great effect. At Blenheim, and other notable
fights, his horsemen practically decided the issue between him and
the French Marshals. How important the arm was considered may
be judged from the fact that at Ramilies the forces on both sides were
little stronger in foot than in horse. Between them the opposing
armies numbered only 75,000 Infantry to 64,000 Cavalry.</p>

<p>About the same time Charles XII. of Sweden was also using
Cavalry in large numbers; and when, under Peter the Great, Russia
began to make her mark among the military powers of the world,
not the least formidable part of her army was the Cavalry, which,
including the afterwards famous Cossacks, amounted at one time to
more than 80,000 men.</p>

<p>Then came the crowning period for Cavalry in modern war. In
spite of their recognised place on the battlefield, and their many
successes, the horsemen of the European armies had not until the
middle of the eighteenth century attained to a full comprehension of
their possible influence. Awed to some extent by the reputation
which the Infantry had gained at their expense in the course of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
last three centuries, the Cavalry had become a less swift and dashing
arm. They had learnt to rely in large measure upon their fire, and
even to fight dismounted as dragoons. “In fact,” according to their
historian Denison, “the cavalry of all European States had degenerated
into unwieldy masses of horsemen, who, unable to move
at speed, charged at a slow trot and fought only with pistol and
carbine.” Even so they were more mobile than Infantry, and had
great achievements to their credit; but they had failed to see that a
recent change in armaments had thrown the game into their hands.
The Infantry, growing over-confident, had discarded the long pike
for the bayonet&mdash;a very poor substitute&mdash;and the Cavalry had once
more a chance of riding down their enemy in fair fight by the speed
and weight of their horses. Their power was now to be taught them
by a keen-sighted soldier, Frederick the Great of Prussia.</p>

<p>When he came to the throne in 1740, and began the career of
unscrupulous aggression which was to make Prussia one of the
leading nations of Europe, he soon saw that his Cavalry was not
all it should have been. “They were,” says Denison, “large men
mounted upon powerful horses, and carefully trained to fire in line
both on foot and on horseback,” but they were quite incapable of
rapid movement, and never attacked Infantry by the ancient method.
“His first change was to prohibit absolutely the use of firearms
mounted, and to rely upon the charge at full speed, sword in hand.”
Marlborough had shown the advantage of using great bodies of
Cavalry in mass, and Marshal Saxe had advocated their being taught
to move at speed for a mile or more in good order. Frederick now
took over both ideas, and by careful and incessant training evolved
a Cavalry which was capable of manœuvring in thousands together
at full pace, even over rough ground, without disorder or loss of
control. Such a force, led by men like Seidlitz and Ziethen, proved
to be almost irresistible. Against Austrians and Russians and
Frenchmen alike, it had astonishing success. “Out of twenty-two
great battles fought by Frederick, his Cavalry won at least fifteen of
them. Cavalry at this time reached its zenith.”</p>

<p>Frederick’s system was copied by all the great military nations
of Europe, and at the close of the eighteenth century the influence
of horsemen in the field was greater than it had ever been since
the battle of Cr&eacute;cy.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span></p>

<p>Then came Napoleon, and though the Cavalry had not such a
pre-eminent place in his armies as in those of Frederick the
Great, for it was not as efficient, yet it was used in vast numbers
and at times with tremendous effect. Murat was perhaps the most
conspicuous figure among all Napoleon’s Marshals, and other
Cavalry leaders made great names for themselves. At Marengo,
at Austerlitz, and in many more of Napoleon’s famous battles, the
French horsemen won undying renown; and if at last his
Cuirassiers had to recoil before the fire of the British squares at
Waterloo, every one knows with what magnificent courage and
devotion they strove again and again to cut their way to victory.</p>

<p>Among Napoleon’s enemies too, Prussian and Austrian, Russian
and British, the Cavalry did much fine work throughout; and it
is not perhaps too much to say that the Russian horsemen,
especially the Cossacks, by destroying his famous squadrons in
the great retreat, were among the most notable causes of his
downfall. This much is certain, that when he fell the Cavalry
of Europe held a high place in the battlefield. Infantry had
become the backbone of most armies, and the power of
Artillery had vastly increased, but Cavalry was still a powerful and
necessary arm.</p>

<p>Then came another marked change in the conditions of war.
A generation after the Conqueror’s death the rifle took the place
of the smooth-bore musket in the hands of the Infantry, and the
same principle was applied to cannon. The result was that the
power of firearms was greatly increased in range and accuracy, and
that the value of Cavalry in battle was proportionately lowered.
Soon afterwards the introduction of breech-loading gave the rifled
weapons a vastly greater rapidity of fire, which also told heavily
against the mounted arm. It was one thing for Cavalry to remain
out of range, a few hundred yards away, and then to charge
against the slow and inaccurate fire of a smooth-bore musket. It
was a very different thing for them to advance from a much
greater distance, against a rifle which not only carried three times
as far as the musket, but shot straight, and could be loaded in a
quarter of the time. From the middle of the nineteenth century
it began to be held, at all events in France and England, that the
chance of a successful attack by Cavalry armed only with the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
sword or lance upon Infantry in the battlefield, except under very
unusual circumstances, was practically at an end. It seemed a
fatal blow to the system of Frederick, and to the hope of the
horseman in his long rivalry with the foot soldier.</p>

<p>That conclusion was not shaken by the wars waged by
European nations during the remainder of the century. Some
successes were gained by Cavalry in various parts of the world
outside Europe. For example, the British Cavalry did fine
work against the Sikhs in 1846 and 1849; a Persian square was
broken and destroyed by a charge of British Indian Cavalry in
1856; and British Cavalry were very useful in the Mutiny soon
afterwards, and against the Chinese; but neither in the Crimea,
nor in the war between France and Austria in 1859, nor in the
war between Prussia and Austria in 1866, nor in the Franco-German
War of 1870, nor in the Russian War against Turkey a
few years later, could the Cavalry claim to have struck such blows
in battle as they had been used to strike in the days of Napoleon.
Colonel Henderson in that fascinating book, ‘The Science of War,’
writing of the “shock tactics” lately prevailing, reviews the
achievements of Cavalry under that system. “Such is the
record,” he says: “one great tactical success gained at Custozza;
a retreating army saved from annihilation at K&ouml;niggratz; and five
minor successes, which may or may not have influenced the
ultimate issue&mdash;not one single instance of an effective and sustained
pursuit; not one single instance, except Custozza, and
there the Infantry was armed with muzzle-loaders, of a charge
decisive of the battle; not one single instance of Infantry being
scattered and cut down in panic-flight; not one single instance
of a force larger than a brigade intervening at a critical moment.
And how many failures! How often were the Cavalry dashed
vainly in reckless gallantry against the hail of a thin line of rifles!
How often were great masses held back inactive, without drawing
a sabre or firing a shot, while the battle was decided by the
infantry and the guns!”</p>

<p>Truly, the day of Cavalry seemed to be over, and this was the
opinion frequently expressed at the end of the century. Their day
was not over.</p>

<p>It will probably have been noticed that so far we have been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
dealing only or mainly with the question of Cavalry on the battlefield.
But their work lies not only on the battlefield&mdash;indeed, it
may be doubted whether their work there, however great, has not
always been of less value than the services they have been able to
render in other ways.</p>

<p>The operations of war are generally treated by military writers
as consisting of two distinct branches&mdash;those leading up to battle,
and those of battle itself. The former are of great variety and
scope, involving all the preparations and manœuvres which will
result in bringing upon the battlefield an army with “every
possible advantage of numbers, ground, supplies, and <i>moral</i>”
over the army of the enemy. These operations are the province
of “strategy.” The operations of the battle itself, when the opposed
armies have actually come into touch, are the province of “tactics.”
The latter are the more picturesque, and naturally appeal to the
fighting spirit of the soldier; but the former are often, if not usually,
of the greater importance to the issue of a war. “Strategy,”
says Henderson, “is at least one half, and the more important
half, of the art of war”; and he says elsewhere: “An army may
even be almost uniformly victorious in battle, and yet ultimately
be compelled to yield.”</p>

<p>Now it may safely be asserted that with regard to strategical
operations there has never been any serious question as to the
great value of Cavalry in any war confined to the land. To quote
Colonel Denison, in “their fitness for scouting, reconnoitring,
raiding, &amp;c., Cavalry have always been the foremost arm and without
rival. In covering an advance, in pursuing a retreating foe, their
capacity has always been unequalled.” Henderson, himself
an Infantry officer, states that “the Cavalry is <i>par excellence</i>
the strategical arm,” that “it depends on the Cavalry, and on the
Cavalry alone, whether the Commander of an army marches blindfold
through the ‘fog of war,’ or whether it is the opposing
General who is reduced to that disastrous plight.” And Von
Bernhardi, discussing the future of Cavalry, says, “It is in the
strategical handling of the Cavalry that by far the greatest
possibilities lie.” He admits that on the battlefield and in
retreat their r&ocirc;le can only be a subordinate one. “But for
reconnaissance and screening, for operations against the enemy’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
communications, for the pursuit of a beaten enemy, and all similar
operations of warfare, the Cavalry is, and remains, the principal
arm.” These passages were written before the aeroplane was
used in war, but they show clearly that until then&mdash;that is,
throughout the nineteenth century&mdash;Cavalry was still as necessary
as ever for the proper working of a campaign.</p>

<p>And further, it may be pointed out that even with regard to the
battlefield, horsemen armed and trained in a different way might
conceivably be of greater use than horsemen depending solely or
mainly upon shock and the <i>arme blanche</i>.</p>

<p>This was proved, though the majority of Continental soldiers
would never open their eyes to the fact, by the fighting in the
American Civil War. Henderson, with clearer vision, writes of this
great conflict: “So brilliant were the achievements of the Cavalry,
Federal and Confederate, that in the minds of military students they
have tended in a certain measure to obscure the work of the other
arms.” No doubt many of these achievements were rather of a
strategical than a tactical nature, but many were not. The American
Cavalry was from first to last constantly used for actual fighting,
and in numberless instances its value as a battle arm was amply
demonstrated. It would be impossible to enumerate them here, but
Henderson expressly declares, for example, that “there is no finer
instance ... of effective intervention (by Cavalry) on the field of
battle than Sheridan’s handling of his divisions, an incident most
unaccountably overlooked by European tacticians, when Early’s
army was broken into fragments, principally by the vigour of the
Cavalry, in the valley of the Shenandoah.” The fact was that,
adapting themselves to the new conditions brought about by rifled
firearms, the Americans had created a mounted service which could
fight both on foot and on horseback, with the rifle or the sword or
the pistol; “they used fire and <i>l’arme blanche</i> in the closest and
most effective combination, against both Cavalry and Infantry.”
Assuredly Cavalry was not yet a negligible arm in battle.</p>

<p>The closing years of the century saw the beginning of another war
in which the horse and his rider were again very prominent. The
Boers, who made so gallant and protracted a fight against the vast
resources of England, were all mounted men, and it was not until
the British forces opposed to them also consisted in a large measure
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
of mounted men that their resistance was broken down. They
differed in many respects from the American Cavalry. The latter
were trained to fight on foot if necessary, but preferred fighting on
horseback whenever they could, though they fought with the pistol
rather than the sword. The Boers fought mainly, almost entirely,
on foot. Their arms and training were inconsistent with fighting
from the saddle. They were in fact rather mobile riflemen than
anything else. Nevertheless the fact remains that they were mounted
men, and that a large part of their value lay in their being so. For
many of the essential duties of Cavalry, for scouting and collecting
information, for raids on their enemy’s communications, for the
capture of his trains and guns, for covering a retirement, they were
exceptionally well fitted. Henderson, writing of the duties of
Cavalry, says: “But most important perhaps of all its functions are
the manœuvres which so threaten the enemy’s line of retreat that
he is compelled to evacuate his position, and those which cut off his
last avenue of escape. A Cavalry skilfully handled, as at Appomattox
or Paardeberg, may bring about the crowning triumph of grand
tactics&mdash;viz., the hemming in of a force so closely that it has either
to attack at a disadvantage or surrender.” The example of
Paardeberg is one in which the triumph was due to the British
Cavalry, but the Boers had some triumphs of the same kind, for
instance at Nicholson’s Nek, and they were very near to gaining one
which might have shaken the Empire. If Ladysmith had fallen,
with its garrison of 12,000 men, as at one time seemed probable, the
disaster would undoubtedly have been due in the main to the mobility
of the Boers, whose rapid movements on horseback enabled them not
only to drive in and besiege White’s troops, but afterwards to hold
up for months, with inferior numbers, Buller’s relieving force, while
still maintaining their grip on the starving garrison. In fact it may
be said that even on the actual field of battle they fought partly as
Cavalry&mdash;Von Bernhardi goes so far as to say “exclusively as
Cavalry,”&mdash;for though they almost invariably dismounted to use their
rifles, yet it was by the speed of their horses that they were able to
extend their flanks, and, galloping out to any threatened point, form
a fresh front against any turning movement. Our slow-moving
Infantry had no chance of getting round and enveloping them, but
was forced time after time to undertake desperate frontal attacks
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
upon the lines, often more or less entrenched, which their rapidity
of manœuvre had made it possible for them to take up. Altogether,
the fighting value of the 50,000 Burghers with whom Paul
Kruger set out to defy Great Britain, was doubled or trebled by the
fact that they were mounted men. It made them in their own
country, and perhaps would have made them anywhere, a formidable
fighting force.</p>

<p>This was not clearly understood on the Continent of Europe,
but it was understood in England. It had a great effect upon the
views of our leading soldiers with regard to the future of Cavalry,
and the subsequent Russo-Japanese War did not in any way contradict
the lessons drawn from the campaigns in America and
South Africa.</p>

<p>To sum up this chapter, it may be said with confidence that
when the Great War broke out the value of Cavalry, both as a
strategical arm and on the field of battle, had been demonstrated
by the experience of three thousand years. During that time it
had fluctuated, especially with regard to the battlefield, but it had
always been great. For some centuries, especially since the
development of efficient firearms, the tendency had been for the
Infantry to oust the horsemen from their pride of place in the
actual shock of armies, and by the end of the nineteenth century
the supremacy of the Infantry in this respect had been generally
acknowledged. But even so it had not been shown that Cavalry,
properly armed and trained, were incapable of joining with effect in
the decision of battles, and the American and South African Wars
had given reason to believe that it certainly could do so. Its
great strategical value was not disputed. Clearly, therefore, Cavalry
was still a necessary and important part of any efficient army&mdash;one
of the most important. Whether for strategical duties or for
full victory in battle, the other arms could not do without the
horsemen.</p>

<p>No doubt the value of Cavalry might be altered in the future,
as it had been in the past, by new developments in the art of war,
but such was the position at that time.</p>

<p>We may now turn to the Thirteenth Hussars.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.<br />

<span class="large">EARLIER HISTORY OF THE REGIMENT.</span></h2>

<p>Before the war of 1914 the Regiment now known as the Thirteenth
Hussars had, like most Regiments of the British Army, served in
various parts of the world. During the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries it had borne a part in nine wars of one kind or another,
and had made acquaintance not only with the Continent of Europe,
but with Asia, America, and Africa.</p>

<p>The Regiment was raised in the year 1715. The Duke of
Marlborough was then still living, but his long series of victories
had been brought to a close by the Treaty of Utrecht two years
before, and thirty thousand of the veterans who had won them for
him had been ruthlessly disbanded.</p>

<p>After the accession of George I., in 1714, it was seen that this
step had been a hasty and dangerous one, for the Jacobite party
was strong, and the reduction of the small British Army had given
them fresh hopes. It soon became evident that the exiled Stuarts
meant to take advantage of their opportunity, and the British
Government was obliged to raise fresh troops in place of those so
recently thrown away. Among the new Regiments were to be
several of Dragoons, and in July 1715 the raising of one of these
was entrusted to Brigadier Richard Munden, an officer on half-pay
who had served with some distinction under Marlborough.</p>

<p>It appears that Munden had no difficulty in finding recruits, for
within three months the Regiment had been raised, and was
assembled at Northampton. There it received orders to march to
Leeds, and soon afterwards Brigadier Munden was informed that
his Regiment, with others, was to be under the orders of Major-General
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
Wills, whom His Majesty had appointed “to command
several of his forces on an expedition.”</p>

<p>At this time a Dragoon Regiment in the British Army consisted
of 6 troops, and its strength was between 200 and 300, including
19 “Commission” officers. It was not a Regiment of “Horse,”
though it was mounted, and regarded as Cavalry. The men
were armed with the same firearm as the Infantry, or practically
the same, and were expected to fight on foot as well as on
horseback. This, it will be remembered, was the period when
European Cavalry depended largely on their fire, and had not been
trained to the system of Frederick the Great, the charge at speed
with the <i>arme blanche</i>. The officers of Munden’s Dragoons,
including Munden himself, had almost all served in Regiments of
Foot.</p>

<p>The Regiment was “officially declared to be a disciplined force
belonging to the regular army on 31st October 1715.” It had not
to wait long before seeing service, for early in November General
Wills learned that the Jacobite “rebels” were over the Scottish
border, and marching on Lancaster. He at once drew together his
forces at Manchester, and marched thence to Wigan. On the 12th
November Munden’s Dragoons were in presence of their first
enemy, who had advanced as far as Preston, and was in occupation
of the town.</p>

<p>It is significant that when General Wills left Wigan with his
force to attack the rebels, the order of march was as follows: The
advance-guard consisted of fifty musketeers and fifty dismounted
dragoons. After the advance-guard came a Regiment of Foot,
then three Brigades of Cavalry consisting of one Regiment of
“Horse” and five of Dragoons. Evidently Cavalry was not
regarded as the eyes of an army.</p>

<p>The action which followed was at first indecisive. The enemy,
superior in numbers, and aided by some guns and barricades,
repulsed one or two attacks made by Infantry and dismounted
Dragoons. But on the following day General Carpenter having
come up with three more Regiments of Dragoons, the rebels gave in
and surrendered. Their assailants had lost in all one hundred
and thirty killed and wounded, so the fighting had not been very
severe. Nevertheless Preston was an affair of some importance, for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
with the indecisive battle of Sheriffmuir, fought the same day by
other troops, it sufficed to put an end to the First Jacobite Rebellion
and to establish the House of Hanover on the British throne.
Munden’s Dragoons had only four wounded during the fight, but
they seem to have behaved well. Munden himself is said to have
led a storming party, and to have been thanked for his gallant
conduct. After the fight, the Regiment seems to have been employed
in escorting to jail the unfortunate prisoners, whose fate
was a sad one.</p>

<p>It may be noted that among the troops who served at Preston
was Dormer’s Regiment of Dragoons, afterwards the Fourteenth
Hussars. Thus began a comradeship between the two Regiments
which was afterwards very close.</p>

<p>Then followed for Munden’s Dragoons, who about this time
became known as the Thirteenth Dragoons, a long period of peace
service. In 1718 there was again a reduction of the Army, and
some Regiments having been disbanded in Ireland, the Thirteenth
were sent over to take the place of one of them. The Irish military
establishment was then separate from the British. The pay of the
troops was somewhat less, and their circumstances in other respects
were very unsatisfactory. It was forbidden to enlist any native of
the country, so that men were hard to get, and the barrack accommodation
was so scanty that the troops were scattered about in
small detachments, to the woeful detriment of their discipline and
efficiency. It apparently became the custom for officers to overstay
their leave, or absent themselves without leave, and everything got
slack in proportion. It was possibly not the fault of the Regiments
that their arms were in most cases insufficient and bad; but in
every way their condition was deplorable. The Thirteenth Dragoons
seem to have suffered like the rest, and probably when their
Colonel, Munden, was transferred to another Regiment in 1722,
they were not in a very efficient condition.</p>

<p>Munden was one of the officers who followed the body of the
great Duke of Marlborough when he was borne to his grave in
Westminster Abbey. He died himself, a Major-General, three
years later, and Colonel William Stanhope became Colonel of the
Thirteenth. This officer, afterwards the Earl of Harrington, was
appointed a Secretary of State in 1730.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span></p>

<p>The stay of the Regiment in Ireland came to an end in 1742,
when it was transferred to Great Britain, and in the following year
the command of it was bestowed upon Lieut.-Colonel James
Gardiner of the Inniskilling Dragoons, then serving in Germany.
Thus when the Second Jacobite Rebellion took place, in 1745,
the Thirteenth, under this well-known officer, was among the
Regiments at the immediate disposal of the Government, and
was fortunate, or unfortunate, enough to find itself engaged once
more on active service.</p>

<p>When Bonnie Prince Charlie unfurled his standard at Glenfinnan,
Sir John Cope, the British General commanding in Scotland, was
very weak in the number and quality of his troops. He had no
gunners to man his few guns, and the force at his disposal to
meet the advancing rebel army, after providing some small
garrisons, amounted to about twenty-five companies of foot and
two Regiments of Dragoons. One of these two was the Thirteenth.
Provisions and transport were very scarce.</p>

<p>It is a curious coincidence that the Regiment came to blows
with its second enemy at another Preston, this time in Scotland.
Close to it was the house of their Colonel, Gardiner. The
Thirteenth had had some trying work during the preceding weeks,
when Cope withdrew his small force from Inverness to Dunbar,
abandoning Edinburgh to the rebels; and the Regiment was not
in good condition, many men and horses being physically unfit
for duty.</p>

<p>The result of the battle is well known. The enemy, chiefly
Highlanders, attacked on the early morning of 18th September.
Cope having no gunners, a Lieut.-Colonel Whiteford and an old
Master Gunner of the name of Griffiths fired a few rounds from
the guns and cohorns, “none of whose shells would burst,” and
then the guns were rushed by the Highlanders. It was a fine
chance for the Cavalry, as the rebels were in confusion, but the
chance was not taken. To tell the simple truth, neither of the two
Dragoon Regiments, Hamilton’s or Gardiner’s, which seem to
have numbered six hundred men between them, could be induced
to charge, and their only inclination was to gallop off the field.
By the exertions of their officers and other gentlemen, about
three-quarters of them were stopped, and brought into Berwick
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
next day; but it must be admitted that their behaviour was
anything but creditable, and the battle ended in the total defeat
of the King’s force. This much is to be said in favour of the
Regiments, that their officers fought gallantly. The ill-fated
Gardiner, who was seriously ill, was wounded at the beginning
of the engagement; and later, when his men refused to charge, he
received several other wounds, from which he died. His Lieutenant-Colonel,
Whitney, was also wounded in trying to rally the men.
But the fight of “Prestonpans” was certainly what Brigadier
Fowke called it, “an unhappy affair.”</p>

<p>After Gardiner’s death the command of the Thirteenth was
given to Colonel Ligonier, a brave officer who had served under
Marlborough, and in the following January it took part in another
battle and another defeat at Falkirk Muir. The same two
Regiments of Dragoons which had been engaged at Prestonpans,
and another, Cobham’s, formed at Falkirk a Brigade of Cavalry
under Ligonier’s orders. This affair was not so discreditable as the
former. The Cavalry, very gallantly led by Ligonier, did charge
the enemy, and it is said penetrated their first line. But they
failed to break the second line, and the charge ended in a confused
retreat. Lieut.-Colonel Whitney, wounded at Prestonpans, was
killed, and the gallant Ligonier also paid for his courage with his
life. Suffering from an attack of pleurisy, he insisted on getting
out of bed to command his Brigade in the battle, which was fought
in a storm of wind and rain. His exertions in rallying the
Dragoons and covering the retreat during the following night were
too much for him, and a week later he died.</p>

<p>The Thirteenth saw no further fighting. When the Duke of
Cumberland broke the Highland clans at Culloden and put an end
to the rebellion, the Regiment was not present. It had been left
in Edinburgh to patrol the roads, and intercept any communications
between the English and Scottish Jacobites. Its
share in the campaign, therefore, had not been a very satisfactory
one. Perhaps it was not to be blamed for the second defeat at
Falkirk, but certainly it had not won much distinction on the
battlefield.</p>

<p>All that can be said is that no troops are likely to do well in
the great ordeal of war unless their discipline and general condition
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
have been steadily maintained in peace. History abounds in such
lessons. The Regiment was to do great things later under more
favourable conditions, and win a fine name for itself as a fighting
corps. Its time was not yet come.</p>

<p>In 1748 the Thirteenth was once more transferred to Ireland,
and there it remained for a second score of years. A Dragoon
Regiment at this time seems to have been very weak in numbers,
considerably under two hundred all told, officers and men, with
one hundred and fifty horses. The prohibition against Irishmen
had apparently been withdrawn, and by 1767 the men were almost
all Irish. But none were Roman Catholics, the enlistment of
these being still absolutely forbidden. The men were fine, most of
them from five foot nine to five foot eleven, and “tolerably well
appointed.” The officers too were mostly Irish. The barrack
accommodation was still very poor, and the Regiment was
scattered in detachments as before. The arms were very bad at
times.</p>

<p>About 1777 the Thirteenth were converted into Light Dragoons,
and much smaller men were enlisted. The example of Frederick
the Great was now being followed on the Continent, and Cavalry
was being trained for greater speed and hand-to-hand fighting.
The Infantry firearm of the Thirteenth gave place to a short
carbine, and some changes were made in the uniform, the old
three-cornered hat making way for a Cavalry helmet. Bayonets
were still carried, but evidently there was some idea of making
the Dragoon more of a horseman and less of a foot soldier.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the state of the British Cavalry at that time as to
equipment and drill was very antiquated. “The military value of
their training,” says Barrett, “was practically <i>nil</i>.” And, to add
to their disadvantages, they were now cursed with the system of
“proprietary Colonels.” How this system came about is not clear,
but towards the end of the eighteenth century it was in full force.
In Munden’s day the Colonel had been “the active officer in
command, and always present, unless on leave, whether at home
or in the field.” Sixty years later, when the old traditions of
Marlborough’s time had been lost, the Regiment was really commanded
by the Lieutenant-Colonel, while the Colonel had become
an absentee, seeing the Regiment perhaps once or twice a year.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
Yet it was in a sense looked upon as his private property. “The
system,” says Barrett, “was a bad one. To bad Colonels were due
the crying abuses of the pay system as well as those of the clothing
system&mdash;the systematic robbery of the soldier, the mean frauds by
which an income was literally swindled out of Government or
sweated off the backs of the men; and the abuse of the power of
the lash was owing to the same cause.” In 1787 the Colonel of
the Thirteenth, a member of Parliament, “lived mainly in London
while the Regiment was in Ireland.” Arms were bad, desertions
frequent, and the duties of the Regiment consisted chiefly of hunting
down members of the various lawless societies in Ireland, Whiteboys
and Peep-o’-Day Boys, and the like. In spite of all these
heartbreaking drawbacks the regimental officers seem to have done
something to make the men efficient, for at times the reports of
inspecting Generals are good enough, though evidently the standard
was not high; and in 1794, no doubt because of the French
Revolution and the outbreak of war on the Continent, the strength
had been increased to 446 men and 393 horses.</p>

<p>The Thirteenth, however, was not yet to be employed in the Continental
war. It was now, after its two campaigns against the
Jacobites, followed by fifty years of peace duty, to have its first
taste of service abroad, but this was not to be in warfare against
a civilised enemy.</p>

<p>In the island of Jamaica the “Maroons,” originally runaway
negro slaves, had long been giving trouble, and it had now become
urgently necessary to suppress them. They held a difficult mountain
country, full of densely wooded glens, from which they had been
wont for many years to raid the lowlands and plantations, plundering
and murdering. After some partial settlements they had again
risen, and had openly defied the white men to war. Their numbers
were not large, perhaps 1200 all told, but as Great Britain was
already fighting the French in the West Indies the complication
was serious, and Lord Balcarres, the Governor, was assembling a
considerable force to blockade the revolted highlands.</p>

<p>It is remarkable to find, considering the nature of the ground,
that in addition to three Regiments of Infantry and some local
militia, this force was to consist of five Dragoon Regiments, of
which two were the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Light Dragoons.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span></p>

<p>The Thirteenth was brought over from Ireland to England in 1795,
and a couple of troops sailed for Jamaica in advance, the remainder
of the Regiment remaining in England until the following February,
when, on the 9th of the month, the Headquarters sailed in the
<i>Concord</i>, which formed part of a fleet numbering more than five
hundred sail. In spite of all the circumstances of its peace service,
the Regiment seems then to have been in a condition of discipline
and efficiency very creditable to officers and men. Fortunate that
this was so, for both were soon to be severely tested. A violent
storm scattered the fleet three days after sailing, and in the Bay
of Biscay the <i>Concord</i> took fire, some pitch used for fumigation
having been upset by the rolling of the vessel, and blazed up. As
the fire was immediately over nineteen casks of powder, the danger
was great. It is pleasant to read how the ship’s company behaved
in this sudden contingency. The Captain, who was writing in his
cabin, ran on deck “with his pen across his mouth.” An officer
was sent down to the hold to cover the powder barrels with wet
blankets and mattresses. “Scores of men, with their mattresses
held in front of them,” threw themselves on the flames and
smothered them, while the officer below spread a sailcloth over the
barrels and kept it wet under a shower of sparks from the deck
above. Eventually, after really heroic exertions, the fire was
brought under, and the ship escaped destruction. Soon afterwards
she sprang a leak, and had to put back to Cove, but all damage
was set to rights in a few days, and on the 26th February the fleet
put to sea again. This time all went well, and on the 1st April
the fleet was assembled in Barbadoes.</p>

<p>After a short stay there, the Thirteenth was sent on to San
Domingo, in which island it remained for some months, helping to
put down a rising of brigands. While doing this work the Regiment,
which till then had been very healthy, was attacked by the scourge
of the West Indies&mdash;yellow fever. Much has been written about
the awful ravages of the disease in those days. It is only necessary
to say here that the Thirteenth suffered as others did. Men died
daily, and at last the Regiment was so reduced that it had to
apply to the Fifty-sixth Foot for help to bury its dead. How
many were left alive does not appear, but by the end of the year
the remains of the Regiment had arrived in Jamaica.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span></p>

<p>It is not easy to follow in detail the course of the campaign
against the Maroons; but it seems that though only two troops of
the Thirteenth were employed in it, the command of the whole
expedition was eventually given to Lieut.-Colonel the Hon. George
Walpole of this Regiment, and that after some hard jungle fighting
and mutual ambuscades the Maroons surrendered to him, on a promise
that they should not be deported. The Jamaica Government broke
this engagement, and voted Walpole a sword of honour, which in
the circumstances was naturally declined.</p>

<p>The Regiment remained in the West Indies until August 1798,
when, after transferring some 95 men to the Jamaica Dragoons, all
that were left, 52 in number, chiefly non-commissioned officers,
sailed under the command of a Lieutenant for England. Of these
52, many were found on arrival to be totally unfit for service, and
were invalided. Most of those not immediately invalided were
“completely exhausted and worn out,” and were gradually
discharged. The Regiment had in fact ceased to exist. During
the two years and six months of its absence, though it had lost
only one man killed in action, it had left behind it, dead of disease,
19 officers, 7 quartermasters, 2 volunteers, and 287 non-commissioned
officers and men. Such were the conditions of service at that time
in the West Indies.</p>

<p>But the war with France was now in full course, and Cavalry
was necessary, so the Commander-in-Chief gave orders that the
Thirteenth be augmented to a strength of 641 men with the same
number of horses. As practically nothing remained of the old
Regiment but a few officers, this meant raising a new one.
Nevertheless, by August 1799, the task had been accomplished, and
two years later the strength had reached 902. The short-lived
Peace of Amiens in 1802 caused it to be reduced again, after the
custom of the times, by about one-half, but the reduction was
as short-lived as the peace, and in 1805, when Napoleon had
assembled his great army at Boulogne for the invasion of England,
the Regiment stood at the highest strength it ever reached, 1064
men, and the same number of horses. From this time on until
1810 the Thirteenth was kept at home. It was then no longer an
Irish Regiment, but a trace of its old connection remained in the
fact that it now had as one of its squadron commanders Colonel
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
Patrick Doherty, who had sailed with it for the West Indies in
1796, and that two of his sons were serving in his squadron.</p>

<p>So far the war record of the Thirteenth can hardly be said to
have been fortunate. In the ninety-five years of their existence
they had served with no special distinction in the two Jacobite
rebellions, and in one campaign abroad, where their chief enemies
had been climate and disease. But this long period of inglorious
and yet trying service was now over. In the next five years, before
their first century came to an end, they were to cross swords
again and again with the finest soldiers in the world, to learn the
lessons of war under the greatest of English commanders, and to
win for themselves imperishable renown.</p>

<p>In February 1810 the Regiment was ordered to prepare 8
troops for immediate service abroad, and before the end of the
month they were on board ship. They left behind 2 troops in
depot at Chichester, and parted with their Commanding Officer,
Colonel Bolton, who had done much to raise and shape the new
Regiment after the West Indian campaign. He had just been
promoted, and was succeeded by Colonel Head from the Twelfth
Dragoons. The 8 troops for active service each numbered 85 men
and 85 horses, or 680 men with officers. Before the end of March
they had disembarked at Lisbon.</p>

<p>The Thirteenth were about to take part in the famous Peninsular
War. Wellington had already given the French some rude shocks
in this quarter, and was soon to establish his reputation as one
of the first soldiers in Europe. He had clearly recognised the power
of offence given to Great Britain by her Navy, which was now
supreme, and he believed that by clinging on to a foothold in
Portugal, he would in time be able to deal a heavy blow to the
military strength of Napoleon, which must be strained by a protracted
struggle at this distant point of the Empire. It was a
fine conception, and the event proved that he had judged correctly.
But at the moment his prospects seemed to be very doubtful, if
not hopeless. Napoleon had large armies in Spain, fully 300,000
men, commanded by some of his most famous Marshals, while
the British force in Portugal was not a tenth of that number,
and badly organised. The Spaniards were evidently incapable of
defending their country, or of giving any effective help in defending
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
it; and Portugal was not strong enough, or united enough, to
do much against such an enemy. Wellington himself was as yet
a man of no great weight in Europe, a mere sepoy General, to
use Napoleon’s words, who was regarded as fit only to fight
Asiatics. He was thwarted and decried in England, where such
successes as he had gained were minimised by party rancour.
Some of his countrymen even wished to omit his name from the
vote of thanks accorded to the troops under his command, and
the force itself was full of complaints and discontent, chiefly on
the part of the officers. It belonged to an Army which had been
discredited by almost constant failure since the War of American
Independence. Even in its own country it was not highly regarded.
And if the British Infantry was now beginning, under Wellington’s
command, to win some measure of the reputation it was soon to
gain as the best in Europe, the British Cavalry was, both in
numbers and training, greatly inferior to the magnificent squadrons
of France. When the Thirteenth landed in Lisbon there seemed
little likelihood of a brilliant future for them. Happily the British
soldier is not greatly disturbed by the prestige of his enemies,
and individually both men and horses were better than the
French. Above all, our troops had now a leader whose indomitable
spirit was proof against all discouragements.</p>

<p>The Thirteenth were soon in the thick of the fighting, but at
first they seem to have been rather helpless. It is recorded that
in July of that year, 1810, the Regiment for the first time found
itself in bivouac, “and both the officers and men were perfectly
ignorant what to do.... Nobody knew what was to be done
for food, forage, &amp;c. Provisions were served out to the men by
the Commissary, but how to cook them was another matter.”
They were soon taught how to find shelter and feed themselves,
but this was the doubtful beginning of a campaign in
which they were to oppose the war-seasoned troops of Napoleon.
Nevertheless, within a few weeks of that date some of them had
twice successfully encountered the enemy’s horsemen, a troop of
the Thirteenth on the second occasion charging through and
capturing more than fifty French Dragoons.</p>

<p>After this, during the summer, the Regiment suffered severely
from sickness, which, however, did not prevent them from being
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
present at the battle of Busaco on the 26th September 1810,
when Mass&eacute;na was met and severely checked in his famous invasion
of Portugal. They were not actually engaged, but were
observing the plain in the left rear of the force while the battle
was fought. As every one knows, Mass&eacute;na was eventually stopped
by the lines of Torres Vedras, and had to retreat. During the
autumn and winter the Thirteenth remained in the country not far
from Lisbon, watching the French and learning their work in
many a rough march.</p>

<p>For some time it is said French and English Dragoons lay on
opposite sides of the Tagus, and the retreat being for the time at
an end, the Thirteenth used to have frequent field-days on a plain
by the river. The vedettes by mutual arrangement refrained from
firing on each other, and the French officers used to come and
look on, sometimes when the river was low exchanging conversation
with their friendly enemies. It was in some ways a chivalrous
warfare, in which, however, the unfortunate Portuguese suffered
terribly from the wasting of the country and exhaustion of supplies.</p>

<p>Then, in the spring of 1811, the enemy retired to the northward
and westward; and a force under Marshal Beresford was
sent to intercept communications from the south. The Thirteenth
formed part of this force, and while under Beresford’s orders it
had the luck to be engaged in a brilliant affair which has since
formed the subject of much controversy. The town of Campo
Mayor had been taken by the French under Latour Maubourg,
and was occupied by a force of 1200 Infantry and over 800
Cavalry, with some Horse Artillery and a battery train of
sixteen heavy guns. On Beresford’s approach this force evacuated
Campo Mayor and retreated on Badajos, ten miles away. The
British Cavalry was sent in pursuit and overtook the enemy.
The action that ensued is not altogether easy to understand;
but the Thirteenth charged, and after some very gallant hand-to-hand
fighting, broke the opposing French Cavalry, pursuing them
up to the gates of Badajos, capturing the whole siege train, with
great quantities of waggons and stores, and leaving the rest of the
garrison to be followed up and secured by Beresford’s heavy
Cavalry and guns. The Thirteenth were naturally pleased and proud
at their success against a very superior enemy; but, by a mistake
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
which was not fully explained at the time, the advance was
stopped, and the Thirteenth given up for lost. They rejoined the
force in safety; but Beresford, misled by false information, believed
they had shown want of discipline after the charge, and reported
in that sense. Wellington, at a distance, and as Fortescue says,
“always justly sensitive over the ungovernable ardour of his
Cavalry,” accepted Beresford’s view, and referred to the Thirteenth
in stinging words. “Their conduct,” he wrote, “was that of a
rabble, galloping as fast as their horses could carry them over a
plain after an enemy to which they could do no mischief after
they were broken.... If the Thirteenth Dragoons are again guilty
of this conduct, I shall take their horses from them, and send the
officers and men to do duty at Lisbon.” This threat was not
communicated to the Regiment, Beresford having meanwhile learnt
something of the truth; but the Thirteenth were nevertheless
severely censured for impetuosity and want of discipline. This
censure, as may be supposed, they deeply resented. Napier, in his
‘History of the Peninsular War,’ says that “the unsparing admiration
of the whole army consoled them.” No doubt to some extent it
did, but not entirely.</p>

<p>Fortescue, after a detailed examination of the incident, sums it
up as follows: “Of the performance of the Thirteenth, who did
not exceed 200 men, in defeating twice or thrice their numbers
single-handed, it is difficult to speak too highly. Indeed, I know
of nothing finer in the history of the British Cavalry.”...
“But more important than all was the admission of the French
that they could not stand before the British Cavalry.” Yet, owing
to the mistakes of their superiors, the Thirteenth never received for
their feat the honour they deserved, or indeed, officially, anything
but blame. It was a signal instance of the ill-fortune which sometimes
attends upon the noblest conduct.</p>

<p>Whatever may be said of this, the Thirteenth had, at all events,
the satisfaction of knowing that they had been thoroughly successful.
They were not always to be so, for on the 5th April, less than a
fortnight later, a troop of the regiment was surprised by French
Cavalry during the night. They were not on outpost duty, having
been regularly relieved, and they supposed that their front had been
secured by the relieving squadron, a body of Portuguese Cavalry
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
under British officers. The men of the Thirteenth had eaten nothing
for two days, and were faint for want of food. After getting a meal,
they lay down by their horses, and were sleeping peacefully when
the French, who were retiring and came upon them by chance,
dashed suddenly among them with the sabre. Two officers and
twenty men escaped in the darkness, but the other two officers
with practically all the rest of the men were taken prisoners. It
is characteristic of warfare in those days that among them was the
wife of one of the troopers.</p>

<p>Then there was another turn of the wheel. Ten days after the
surprise it was reported that a body of French Cavalry was at Los
Santos, levying contributions. The British Cavalry advanced to
attack them, and Marshal Beresford himself rode with the
Thirteenth, whom he had so severely censured less than a month
before. A sharp fight ensued, ending in the rout of the enemy,
who were pursued for about nine miles and lost some hundreds of
prisoners. The loss of the Thirteenth was very small.</p>

<p>The next month saw the bloody battle of Albuera, which forms
the subject of one of Napier’s most famous chapters. During the
day the Thirteenth were employed in holding off the enemy’s
Cavalry. They were exposed to severe fire from Infantry and guns,
but were successful in carrying out their duty without heavy loss.</p>

<p>There was much hard work for the Thirteenth during the
remainder of this year, 1811, and one incident is noteworthy. On
the 21st November, Lieutenant King, a fine young officer, was shot
by Spanish guerillas when carrying a flag of truce to the fortress of
Badajos. His body was recovered by the French and buried with
all military honours on the ramparts, General Philippon assembling
the whole garrison under arms for the purpose.</p>

<p>During 1812 the Thirteenth again saw some rough service. They
shared in the advance to Madrid and Alva de Tormes, and then in
the retreat back to Portugal, during which their horses suffered
terribly from hardship and starvation.</p>

<p>In April 1813 the British army advanced again, and again reached
Alva de Tormes. In June the French took up their position at
Vittoria, and the famous battle ensued. The share of the Thirteenth
in this combat was interesting. After some sharp fighting they
captured King Joseph’s carriages and equipment, and then pressed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
on in pursuit of the beaten enemy, whose losses were great, including
over a hundred and fifty guns. Vittoria was in fact the break-up
of Napoleon’s power in Spain, for many of his commanders and
troops had been withdrawn the year before to strengthen his army
for the Russian campaign, and he was never able to replace them.</p>

<p>Then followed the march to the French frontier and the battles of
the Pyrenees. In November the Thirteenth crossed the border.</p>

<p>The winter was a hard one for the Cavalry. Hilly country intersected
by deep ravines, exhausted of supplies, and obstinately defended
by Soult and his veterans, was a rough scene for outpost duty. There
were many small affairs, especially between foraging parties. The
weather was very bad, and the troops had constantly to bivouac in
the mud, under torrents of rain, sometimes in snow. There was often
no corn or straw for the horses, nothing procurable but gorse, which,
pounded and made into a sort of paste, Irish fashion, just kept the
poor beasts alive.</p>

<p>One incident which occurred near Orthes, on the 27th February
1814, is striking. The Thirteenth there came in contact with Soult’s
Cavalry, and charged. At their head rode their Lieutenant-Colonel,
Patrick Doherty, with his sons, Captain and Lieutenant Doherty,
three abreast. The charge was completely successful, and many
prisoners were taken, among them two officers.</p>

<p>Napier has told us how, through the spring of 1814, that fierce
fighting went on, in snow and rain and misery&mdash;the French, now
overmatched, losing battle after battle and many thousands of men,
but still, under their indomitable leader Soult, turning to bay again
and again. Then at last came the battle of Toulouse, and the white
cockade began to show itself, and on the 13th April it was known that
peace had been declared. Napoleon had fallen. Soult fought on for
five days more, but then it was announced in general orders that
hostilities had ceased, and the British Cavalry in pursuit beyond
Toulouse desisted from further action.</p>

<p>The Thirteenth had fought almost without interruption for
four years, in the long struggle that began at Lisbon and ended at
Toulouse. They now had a few weeks’ rest, and it was badly needed.
Numbers of horses, worn out by want and hard work, had to be
destroyed, and the men were in rags. No clothing had been issued
during the winter. “Overalls patched with cloth of all sorts of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
colours, and most frequently of red oilskin&mdash;fragments of baggage-wrappers
by the way&mdash;were universal or almost so.” They were
indeed “The Ragged Brigade,” as they and their old comrades of the
Fourteenth had been named. But, starting in May, they marched up
through France, and arriving at Boulogne on the 5th July, embarked
for England. By the 8th July the Regiment had all been landed in
Ramsgate. During an absence of four years and five months the
Thirteenth had marched 6000 miles, and had been engaged in twelve
battles and thirty-two “affairs,” many sharply contested. They
had lost by death six officers and 270 men. But the Regiment had
now made its mark, and was thenceforward one of the foremost
fighting corps of the British Cavalry.</p>

<p>After their return from France the Thirteenth spent some months
in England and Ireland, but their enjoyment of peace was short.
In February 1815 Napoleon escaped from Elba, and war again broke
out. On the 20th April, having meanwhile received royal authority
to bear on its guidons and appointments the word “Peninsula,” the
Regiment was ordered to prepare six troops for immediate service,
and soon afterwards the number was increased to ten. In May the
Thirteenth were in Ostend (with twenty-eight women and nine
children), and by the end of the month they formed part of a force
of 6000 Cavalry, under Lord Uxbridge, which was inspected by
Wellington and Bl&uuml;cher.</p>

<p>Then followed Quatre Bras and Waterloo. The movements of
the Thirteenth up to the morning of the decisive battle are of no
special interest, but it seems that having been ordered to join a
Brigade consisting of the Seventh and Fifteenth Hussars under Major-General
Grant, the Regiment arrived at Quatre Bras on the night of
the 16th June, and shared in the retreat of the 17th June to Waterloo.
It was a dreary day, for the rain was heavy and they got no food&mdash;a
bad preparation for the coming battle. Then followed “a dreadful
rainy night, every man in the Cavalry wet to the skin,” and at four
o’clock in the morning of the 18th, the Thirteenth “turned out and
formed on the field of battle in wet corn and a cold morning without
anything to eat.” Their commanding officer, the gallant old veteran
Colonel Doherty, had broken down and was lying ill in Brussels, so
the Regiment was commanded on the 18th by Lieut.-Colonel Boyse.
The Brigade to which it belonged was posted on the right centre
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
of the army, in rear of Byng’s Brigade of Guards, who held the
house and garden of Hougomont. From this position the Thirteenth
witnessed the furious fighting which ensued between the
Guards and their French assailants, and they came themselves
under heavy Artillery fire, which caused them some loss. Colonel
Boyse had his horse killed under him by a cannon-shot, and was
severely hurt, the command devolving on Major Lawrence. Two
other officers were wounded. There was also severe and repeated
Cavalry fighting, in which the Thirteenth did their share, charging
more than once the enemy’s horsemen, and on one occasion dispersing
a square of French Infantry. In this fighting they lost
three officers killed or mortally wounded,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> and two more wounded
by sabre cuts. Towards evening the French made another desperate
attack with both Cavalry and Infantry, and the Thirteenth
charged again, losing three more officers wounded, among whom
were both the Doherty brothers. Before the enemy finally gave
way almost every officer of the Regiment had lost one horse at
least, and Major Lawrence had lost three. When at last the
French broke, the Brigade was sent in pursuit, and pressed the
routed enemy until nine o’clock. Then it was halted, and the pursuit
was handed over to the Prussians. “The last charge,” wrote an
officer of the Thirteenth, “was literally riding over men and horses,
who lay in heaps.” And the account goes on to say that “when
the Regiment mustered after the action at 10 <small>P.M.</small> that night, we had
only 65 men left out of 260 who went into the field in the morning.”</p>

<p>Many rejoined later, and these figures do not represent the actual
losses as afterwards ascertained, but so far as can be judged the
total of killed and wounded was close upon a hundred, of whom
eleven were officers.</p>

<p>After Waterloo, the Thirteenth marched to Paris, where they
remained some weeks, and then they were sent northward again.
At or near Hazebrouck, a name now so familiar, they remained
some months. In May 1816 the Regiment returned to England,
arriving at Dover on the night of the 13th. During the past year
it had lost in killed, died, and discharged, 3 officers and 65 men.</p>

<p>With Waterloo ended the first century of the Regiment’s
service. If ninety-five years of it had been rather colourless, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
last five had certainly been as full of fighting as any one could have
desired.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_034" src="images/i_034.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">INDIA</p></div>

<p>For about three years after its return the Thirteenth remained
in England. The times which followed the war were bad, and the
Regiment was often employed maintaining order among the civil
population, always a detestable duty for soldiers, but nothing of
note occurred. On the 9th February 1819 the Regiment sailed for
India, and for the next twenty years it rested peacefully in Eastern
cantonments.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">OFFICER OF THE 13TH LIGHT HUSSARS<br />
<small>1830-1836</small></p></div>

<p>In India, as well as in Europe, the beginning of the century
had been a time of hard fighting in various fields, and when the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
Thirteenth went out, the supremacy of the British among the
Indian country powers had hardly been established. It was only
sixteen years since Sir Arthur Wellesley had routed the Maratha
armies at Assaye, and gained his first great victory. After that
time other powers had challenged the British, and been with
difficulty overthrown. Even in 1819 there remained serious
elements of disorder, and it was not until seven years later that
a period of complete peace began. Nevertheless, it may be
said that the period of general war closed in Asia as in Europe
soon after the fall of Napoleon.</p>

<p>The Thirteenth at all events had no fighting to do. They
were sent to the extreme south of India, where the name of their
old chief was very familiar, and the provinces about Bangalore,
where they were quartered, had many fighting traditions; but
nothing occurred to test the spirit of the Regiment. In that
very pleasant place, and other stations not far distant, the
Thirteenth remained year after year, with little to disturb them
except inspections and reviews, enjoying plenty of sport, after the
manner of British Cavalry Regiments in the East, and maintaining
their efficiency in so far as it could be maintained without service
in the field. In 1832 a formidable plot was discovered for a
native rising in Bangalore. The Thirteenth with a British Infantry
Regiment, the Sixty-Second, and a detachment of European
Artillery, were to be suddenly attacked at night and massacred,
after which the conspirators hoped that a general mutiny of the
Native Army would follow. But the plot was revealed by a faithful
native officer, and was crushed without any fighting.</p>

<p>Nevertheless it had shown that there was disaffection among the
Indian population, and a few years later this came to a head. In
1839 it was found that a certain Mahomedan chief, the Nawab of
Karnul, had collected in secret a large quantity of military stores,
including some “hundreds” of guns, and that he had in his employ
a considerable number of sturdy fighting men, Arabs, Rohillas, and
Pathans from the North-West of India&mdash;the turbulent mercenaries
who had for generations made India a vast battlefield. The matter
was considered so serious that a force of 6000 men, of which two
squadrons of the Thirteenth formed part, was sent to Karnul.
Action had been taken in time, and the fighting on the part of
the enemy at Karnul and the neighbouring village of Zorapur,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
though brave enough, was soon over. A few British officers and
men were killed and wounded. The Thirteenth lost more than
thirty men, chiefly from cholera, on this expedition, but none by
the sword. It was one of the countless forgotten skirmishes
upon which the Indian Empire has been built up.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<p>Early in 1840, after twenty-one years spent in the country, the
Thirteenth sailed for home. They had seen little fighting, but
those were days when India claimed a terrible toll from British
troops, and during the short march from Bangalore to the coast at
Madras the Regiment lost from cholera forty more men, as well as
many women and children. Cholera is no longer the scourge that
it was to our countrymen, but the thousands of graves that one
finds scattered over the face of the land, often in the loneliest places,
are a sad reminder of the price Great Britain has paid for her
Eastern dominion.</p>

<p>On return to England the Regiment was very weak, for in
addition to its losses from disease, it had left behind many men
who had volunteered for other Regiments in India; but it was
soon in good order again. It was to be replaced in India by the
Fourteenth, and in 1841 the two Regiments, “The Ragged
Brigade” of the Peninsular War, met again in Canterbury. There
can have been few officers in either who had served together in
that war, but the old traditions were still alive, and in remembrance
of them the Fourteenth presented to the sister Regiment
their mess-table, which had been originally captured by the
Thirteenth at Vittoria with King Joseph’s household.</p>

<p>During the next ten years and more the Thirteenth served in
the United Kingdom, and there is little to record of their doings.
In 1852 they formed part of the troops who followed the funeral of
their old chief, the Duke of Wellington, and in the next year they
attended the first camp of exercise held in England. The Duke
had originated the idea. The camp was a success, and proved to
be the precursor of many more such gatherings. But something
more than camps of exercise was now before the Regiment. In
1854 came war with Russia, and the Thirteenth were warned for
service in the field. By the middle of May they had sailed for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
the East. It is memorable that they were now once more commanded
by a Lieut.-Colonel Doherty.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">OFFICER OF THE 13TH LIGHT HUSSARS<br />

<p>The Regiment had some rough work in European Turkey before
going on to the Crimea; but in September 1854 it landed at
Eupatoria with the Allied forces, and on the 19th of that month it
marched towards Sebastopol as part of the Light Brigade under
Lord Cardigan. The opening day of the march brought the
Thirteenth under fire, and they had a few casualties, which were,
it is said, the first in the British army. The enemy withdrew
with some loss, and on the following day the whole of the Allied
armies, British, French, and Turkish, advanced to the banks of
the Alma.</p>

<p>Every one knows the story of the battle which ensued&mdash;how
the Allies attacked the Russian troops holding the heights across
the stream, the British redcoats on the left, the dark masses of
the French and Turks on the right; and how, after some stubborn
fighting, the Russians were driven off the heights upon the plain
beyond. The Light Brigade had little to do during the attack.
Their position was on the left front of the British army, where
they remained all the afternoon, watching the development of the
struggle, and facing large bodies of Russian Cavalry and guns
which threatened the flank of our advance. They never did more
than threaten, and the Light Brigade had no fighting, though
there was some slight loss from Artillery fire. When finally the
Russians were driven off the heights, the British Cavalry was sent
in pursuit, and crossing the stream at a gallop, pressed up and
over the hills, to see below them the beaten enemy in full retreat.
Some prisoners were made, and the Russian rearguard was watched
as long as daylight lasted, but nothing of much importance occurred.
The battle had been won, and the Russians had suffered
heavily, but the bulk of their troops maintained some order, and
there was no general rout. The Thirteenth spent the night in
bivouac, on ground which had to be cleared of many dead.</p>

<p>There followed a month of comparative freedom from fighting,
while the Allied armies closed on Sebastopol and took up their
position for a siege. The work of the Cavalry was constant, in
exploring the country and watching the enemy, but until the 25th
October no serious encounter took place. Then occurred the
famous battle of Balaclava.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span></p>

<p>It was a day on which, to an exceptional extent, Cavalry shared
in the actual shock of battle, and not only as horsemen against
horsemen, but in conflict with other arms. The Russian Cavalry,
far more numerous than the British, were the assailants, but it
may safely be said that at the end of the day, heavy as our losses
had been, and unnecessarily heavy, the British horsemen had
established for themselves a personal superiority which was never
again challenged.</p>

<p>The action began about daybreak, the Russians advancing in
great force to attack certain outlying redoubts held by Turks,
which were incapable of much resistance. The Light Brigade
and a troop of British Horse Artillery moved out to support the
defence, but the redoubts fell quickly and were soon in Russian
hands. Then the Russian Cavalry, some three thousand or more
in number, with over thirty guns, advanced to complete the
Russian success, and to threaten Balaclava itself, which, although
of vital importance to our army, was for want of numbers very
weakly held. First a body of the enemy’s horsemen came on
boldly against the 93rd Highlanders, who, with some men of the
Guards, received them steadily and drove them off by a couple of
volleys at close quarters. Then the main body of the enemy’s
horse came up unseen by our own Cavalry, and suddenly appeared
on the heights within a few hundred yards of Scarlett’s Heavy
Brigade, which was advancing in imperfect formation through
the tents and picket ropes of the camp to support the 93rd.
Fortunately the Russians, instead of launching their Cavalry mass
upon our greatly outnumbered squadrons, came slowly down the
slope, and halted&mdash;and then the Heavy Brigade dashed into their
ranks. Within ten minutes the great mass, nearly three thousand
strong, had been riven by successive charges and scattered over
the plain with a loss of 400 men, and Scarlett’s troopers, a fifth
of their number, rode back in triumph.</p>

<p>This feat was performed under the eyes of the Light Brigade,
who sat on their horses, impatiently expecting the order to advance
and join in the fight, or at all events in the pursuit of the broken
enemy. According to Colonel Tremayne, then a Captain in the
Thirteenth, some squadrons instinctively fronted that way; and it
seems likely enough that if the Light Brigade had charged the enemy
in flank while they were engaged with Scarlett’s men, great execution
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
might have been done; but Lord Cardigan considered that
his orders forbade him to move, and the opportunity was not taken.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_038fp" src="images/i_038fp.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">BEFORE THE CHARGE OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE AT BALACLAVA<br />
<small>25TH OCTOBER 1854</small></p></div>

<p>Then followed the separate attack about which so much has
been written. It appeared to the British Commander-in-Chief
that the Russians were about to carry off the guns captured in
the lost redoubts, and he directed the Cavalry to advance rapidly
and try to prevent them. What exactly the Light Brigade was
ordered or meant to do has been a matter of endless controversy;
but this much is certain, that 673 officers and men, of five Regiments,
charged a Russian battery in position at the end of a valley a mile
or more in length, other Russian batteries and bodies of Infantry
being on the sides of the valley, and some Russian Lancers and
Hussars in rear of the battery attacked. The Thirteenth, now
reduced to a strength of 8 officers and a little more than a hundred
men, were with the Seventeenth Lancers in the front line. Behind
them came the Eleventh, Fourth, and Eighth Hussars. In front of
all, straight into the enemy’s guns, rode the Commander of the
Brigade, Lord Cardigan. He had been much criticised for habitually
sleeping on board his yacht, which lay in the harbour below, and
other allegations were made against him, but there was at all
events no question as to his courage. The charge was a mad one,
due to some misconception. The Brigade reached its objective,
but was practically destroyed in the course of the charge and
return. When the remnants of the Light Brigade re-formed in rear
of the Heavy Brigade, which had not been sent in, it was seen
that the losses had been ruinous. The Thirteenth was represented
by 1 wounded officer and 14 men. Others rejoined later, but the
Regiment lost that day 3 officers and 11 others killed, 12 men
taken prisoners, and 30 wounded. The officer in command, Captain
Oldham, was among the killed. It was a fatal ride, and the
Brigade was sacrificed to little purpose; but officers and men had
obeyed their orders with splendid devotion, and it is no wonder
that among the Regiments which formed the Brigade the memory
of “Balaclava Day” is held in everlasting honour.</p>

<p>The Thirteenth was present a few days later at the bloody
battle of Inkerman, where it had no chance of doing anything, and
then went through the miseries of the Crimean winter, when men
and horses suffered terribly from want of food and clothing. In
February the effective strength of the Regiment, exclusive of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
officers, was 5 mounted men&mdash;namely, 1 sergeant, 1 trumpeter, and
3 privates. Lieut.-Colonel Doherty, who had been absent, ill, on
the day of the famous charge, was now fit for service again, but
that was the strength of his command. During the ensuing spring
and summer, successive drafts brought up the number, and
when the battle of the Tchernaya was fought in August 1855,
the Thirteenth turned out 200 strong. They came, it is said, very
near disaster again that day in consequence of an order by the
Sardinian General della Marmora, to whom their services had
been lent, and were only saved by the interposition of Marshal
Pelissier from another hopeless charge at a Russian battery.
After the fall of Sebastopol the Regiment had some more hard
work in small expeditions, but no more severe fighting. On the
27th May 1856, they were back at Portsmouth.</p>

<p>After their return from the Crimea, the Thirteenth had ten years
of peace service in the United Kingdom. There is nothing memorable
about this period except that in 1861 or 1862 they became
Hussars instead of Light Dragoons.</p>

<p>In 1866 the Regiment was suddenly ordered to Canada, where the
Fenian conspiracy had given rise to some excitement; but the
invasion proved a fiasco, and the Thirteenth saw no active service.
They returned to England in 1869.</p>

<p>In 1870 the Thirteenth were once more ordered out to India,
and there they remained for fourteen years. This time they were
not sent to the south of the great peninsula, but to the north, to
Hindustan proper, where there was more chance of stirring times.
India, as one of the best of its Viceroys used to say, is a country
where “the bottom is always dropping out of the bucket,” and the
task of putting matters to rights generally falls to the troops in the
north, where the bulk of the British garrison is always kept.</p>

<p>There was in fact some active work for the northern army while
the Thirteenth formed a part of it, for in 1878 occurred the Second
Afghan War, in the course of which there was much fighting in
Kabul and Kandahar. But the Thirteenth had not the good fortune
to see it. They were, it is true, sent to Kandahar in 1880,
remaining across the border about a year, but in that part of the
country the fighting was over, and they returned to India.</p>

<p class="caption">13TH LIGHT DRAGOONS 1854</p></div>

<p>In 1884 the Thirteenth left India for home again, but they were
sent by way of South Africa, where, in Natal, they spent a year.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
From Natal they returned to England. In the United Kingdom
they spent the next fourteen years.</p>

<p>Thus it appears that from 1856 to 1899, forty-three years, the
Regiment never had the good fortune to see a shot fired in anger.
But a considerable part of that time was spent in various parts of the
world, in Canada, Asia, and Africa, and the experience gained in such
service is not without value. If at times prolonged absence from home
may entail a certain loss of smartness, it has its compensations.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1899 the Boer republics issued their ultimatum
to Great Britain, and crossed the border of Natal. The Thirteenth
was among the Regiments immediately sent out to strengthen the
British forces in South Africa; and as by the time it arrived
Sir George White was besieged in Ladysmith, it was ordered to
join General Buller’s relieving force in Natal. On the 12th
December it was included in Lord Dundonald’s Cavalry Brigade.
Three days later occurred Buller’s attempt to force the passage of
the Tugela at Colenso, and the Thirteenth was in action throughout
the day. The Adjutant, it may be observed, Captain Tremayne,
was the son of one of the eight officers who charged at Balaclava.
From this time until the 3rd March, the Thirteenth shared all the
rough fighting that took place in trying to break through the strong
semicircle of hills held by the Boers. Then the relieving force
entered Ladysmith in triumph. After that the Thirteenth served
throughout the war, and saw much hard work.</p>

<p>It was not until October 1902 that they returned to England,
after an absence of nearly three years. In the course of the campaign
they had lost eighty men killed in action or by disease, while four
officers and forty-six men had been wounded, and a large number
invalided home. The Regiment fully maintained its reputation,
and received many honours.</p>

<p>Two uneventful years in England followed, and then for the
third time the Thirteenth were sent out to India, where they were
still serving in 1910. With the beginning of that year Barrett’s
history of the Regiment ends. It had then been in existence nearly
200 years, and had served in nine wars, among which were the
Peninsular War, the Waterloo Campaign, the Crimean War, and
the South African War. In all of these it had done well and
distinguished itself. Its reputation, whether in war or peace,
stood high.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.<br />

<span class="large">1910-1914&mdash;OUTBREAK OF THE GREAT WAR.</span></h2>

<p>In the beginning of 1910 the Thirteenth Hussars had been more
than five years in India, and again in the south, where their first
Indian service had passed. The military station of Secunderabad,
in the dominions of His Highness the Nizam, the greatest of the
Mahomedan Chiefs of India, had long been one of the strategical
points at which a considerable force of all arms was kept, and a
British Cavalry regiment almost always formed part of the garrison.
It is, or was then, as Indian stations go, one of the pleasantest and
most sociable, with some sport to be got in the neighbourhood;
and, owing to the size of the garrison, there was plenty of amusement,
as well as work, in the Cantonment itself. The Nizam and
those about him were always friendly and hospitable.</p>

<p>The Thirteenth were not to be in Secunderabad much longer,
but in May, while they were still there, occurred the lamented
death of King Edward VII., and the accession of King George. On
the 9th May the officers of the Regiment, with a party of non-commissioned
officers and men, attended at the British Residency
at Hyderabad, the capital of the Nizam’s dominions, and there
heard read the proclamation announcing the beginning of a new
reign. It was to prove one of the most memorable in the history
of India.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_042fp" src="images/i_042fp.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE DRUM HORSE&mdash;AT THE DURBAR</p></div>

<p>During the remainder of the hot season, which in the East is
necessarily the slack season so far as military training is concerned,
the regimental records contain notice of little beyond routine
occurrences and sport of various kinds, the football and polo and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
tent-pegging with which men and officers while away the heat and
tedium of an Indian summer. Then, as the heat slackened and
another working season began, the Regiment received orders to
move from the south of India to the north, to a station nearly a
thousand miles away, among a totally different population and
surroundings. The Thirteenth left Secunderabad in the middle
of October, carrying with them the hearty good wishes of the
garrison, and of the General Commanding the Cavalry Brigade, who
warmly praised their work and discipline, and expressed his confidence
that they would maintain in the north of India the good
name they had borne in the south.</p>

<p>Arriving in the northern plains by train, they marched to their
new station, meeting on the line of march the Seventeenth Lancers,
with whom they had charged at Balaclava more than fifty years
earlier. The two Regiments had not met since. The Thirteenth
entertained the Lancers to a camp-fire concert, and then they went
their ways again.</p>

<p>Meerut, where the Thirteenth were now to be quartered, was
a well-known and favourite station. It was memorable as the place
at which occurred the first serious outbreak of the Mutiny of 1857,
since which time it had, from its central position and nearness to
the ancient capital of Delhi, continued to be a large military
station. In 1910 the memories of the Mutiny had grown dim, but
Meerut was still an important place from a military point of view.
It lay in the centre of “Hindustan,” the great northern block of
territory which has been the seat of countless Empires, Hindu and
Mahomedan&mdash;the real India upon which the vast Indian Peninsula
has in a measure depended for thousands of years. In its broad
plains and teeming cities was always concentrated the military
power of succeeding conquerors, and the British, when they took
the place of the Moghuls, had, like their predecessors, massed their
strength on these northern plains.</p>

<p>Meerut, it may be noticed, was also a centre of sport, the site
of an annual polo tournament, and within reach of good shooting
and “pig-sticking.” The Thirteenth arrived just in time to join in
the polo tournament, and to be soundly beaten by their Balaclava
comrades of the Seventeenth Lancers. They were also beaten
soon afterwards at another tournament at Lucknow, this time by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
the Rifle Brigade; but every one cannot win, and the Thirteenth
were at all events to the fore in every kind of sport.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the usual work of military training began again&mdash;drill
and swimming camps, and marches, and musketry, and
inspections, and much more&mdash;the steady hard work of which
civilians as a rule have no knowledge, but very real and useful
work for all that, as the old Army was to show in the dark days
which were coming.</p>

<p>Then followed the summer of 1911, and in the autumn the 13th
received news of the death of their Colonel-in-Chief, General Sir
Baker Russell. He was succeeded by General Sir Robert Baden-Powell.</p>

<p>But this year, 1911, was not to close with another round of
customary training. King George had shown from the first, as his
father and Queen Victoria had shown before him, a keen interest
in his Indian Empire. As Prince of Wales he had visited the
country already; now he had decided to visit it again as King-Emperor,
and to take his seat in person upon the Imperial throne.
It was a momentous decision, and was to have a great effect upon
the Chiefs and people of India&mdash;how great an effect those only can
know who have studied and in some measure understood the
traditions and feelings which thousands of years of kingly rule have
implanted in the Indian mind. Happily King George understood,
and had resolved to take the unprecedented step of leaving England
for months to gratify the desire of his Indian subjects. In the whole
history of India no such ceremonial had ever been held, for vast as
the Empire of the Moghuls had been, it had never embraced the
whole of the Eastern dominions now under the British Crown,
nor had it formed part of a wider Empire extending to all the
continents of the world.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_044fp" src="images/i_044fp.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">D SQUADRON&mdash;AT THE DURBAR</p></div>

<p>Among the preparations being made to invest the ceremonial
with due pomp and splendour, was the assembly at the Imperial
Camp of a military force drawn from the Army of India. The
occasion was not primarily a military one, and the numbers of the
force were limited; but 50,000 troops, British and Indian, were
being drawn together to represent the armed might of the greatest
power in the East, and to show that if ever he chose, the British
Emperor of India would be able to throw into the scale of any
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
world-conflict an army in which the military efficiency of the West
would be blended with the loyal devotion and numbers of the
Indian fighting races. Among the Regiments which had the
honour of being included in the representative force at Delhi was
the Thirteenth Hussars.</p>

<p>The various pageants which took place have been described in
detail by Fortescue, the historian of the British Army, who accompanied
the King to India. The great Durbar at which the
King took his seat upon the throne was a wonderful scene, all
classes of the Indian population joining to do him honour, from
the humblest to the great feudatory chiefs and their retainers,
blazing with jewels and gorgeous clothing and antique armour.
The Thirteenth did their part among the soldiers, of whom Fortescue
says: “The troops formed the most essential part of the pageant.”
Besides the Durbar, there were many other interesting ceremonies
and amusements&mdash;the presentation of colours, receptions, polo and
football matches, and so on. But the whole did not last many days.
The vast encampment, covering twenty-five square miles, which had
risen as if by magic, with its myriads of tents and its luxurious
gardens, from the solitude of a barren plain, was gone before the
end of the year. The Chiefs of India marched away with their
brilliant retinues, the troops and the people were scattered in
every direction, and the plains about Delhi relapsed into something
like their old lonely peace. But before he went the King had
announced with dramatic suddenness, to the astonishment of the
great assembly, that Delhi was again to be the capital of India,
and that the British Empire, which had risen from the sea, and
had hitherto had a seaport for its capital, was for the future to be
centred, as former Empires had been, on the plains of Hindustan,
surrounded by the territories of the Indian chiefs and the lands
of the great Indian fighting races. It was a landmark in the
history of India.</p>

<p>To the officers and men of a British Cavalry Regiment the full
significance of the ceremonial could hardly perhaps be apparent,
and certainly they could not foresee the world-war which was soon
to show how fortunate in its consequences had been the King’s act
in coming to India at the beginning of his reign. Pageants are
hardly to the mind of a soldier. Still, the Thirteenth had their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
part in it, and did well what they had to do. The Regiment was conspicuous
among those reviewed by the King, and at the close of the
ceremonial it was selected for the honour of furnishing a squadron
to escort the Queen during her visit to another ancient capital,
Agra. The squadron was under the command of Captain W. H.
Eve. Fortescue writes of it: “We had remarked the Regiment
at Delhi; but even so we were not quite prepared for what we saw
on that Sunday. All the officers of the suite agreed that the escort
was the most perfect they had ever seen, so admirably were the
distance and the dressing preserved. This may seem to be a small
matter, but such details count for much in the discipline of a
regiment, for those that are careful in small matters are unlikely
to be careless in great. Moreover, it is a real pleasure in this
imperfect world to see anything faultlessly done.”</p>

<p>Fortescue’s words may perhaps seem exaggerated: smartness
and discipline are not necessarily the same thing. But they are
nearly allied, and there is perhaps no greater mistake made by
civilians in judging soldiers than the contempt for drill and “the
barrack-yard” which is so readily expressed. Henderson writes in
‘The Science of War’: “It is unfortunately to be apprehended that
few, except professional soldiers, understand the nature or the value
of discipline.” And he shows very clearly how necessary is the
“habit of obedience” for efficient action in war. It was not for
nothing that the great American soldier Stonewall Jackson began
his career in the Civil War by drilling his undisciplined soldiery
until he made himself detested by the officers and men who afterwards
learnt to worship him. His brigade stood “like a stone
wall” in their first battle when all was melting around them, and
earned him the splendid nickname which has become immortal.
History teems with instances of the supreme value of the trained
soldier in war. Never was it shown more conspicuously than in
that wonderful month of the retreat from Mons, when the little
army of British regulars went back day after day before the overwhelming
numbers of their enemy, only to turn on him at the end
and prove to him that in spite of all their losses and sufferings their
spirit and efficiency were still unbroken. “It is open to those in
whose ears the very name of discipline smacks of slavery, to assert
that a powerful instinct of obedience dwarfs the intellect, turns the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
man into a machine, and rusts his power of reasoning; and in this
there is a shadow of truth, but it is only a shadow.” It is a
question which has been often debated, and in which, <i>prim&acirc; facie</i>,
the contemptuous critic seems to have much right on his side; but
to few who have seen war will his view commend itself. The
Regiment which shows up well in the manœuvres of the parade-ground
will rarely fail to show itself efficient in the field. Like
everything else, the principle is capable of abuse, and may be
carried too far, but it is a sound principle in the main. Certainly
the squadron which won Fortescue’s admiration went very straight
when it was tried a few years later in something more than escort
duty.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">THE QUEEN AT AGRA</p></div>

<p>The Durbar and its attendant ceremonies at an end, the
Thirteenth marched back to Meerut, and the old life of military
training and sport began again. There were rifle meetings and
inspections, drill and manœuvres, courses in musketry and signalling
and machine-guns, polo and races; and then the hot weather
of India came once more with its blinding sandstorms and weary
nights of heat, when sleep was hard to get and life seemed hardly
worth living. There was some sickness too, and the terrible spectre
of plague cast its shadow over the Regiment. The men faced the
shadow cheerily enough, playing football and hockey and having
boxing competitions after the manner of the British soldier; but one
or two died, and the Regiment had to be inoculated. The officers
kept themselves fit with polo and the swimming-bath. July brought
some welcome rain, two or three good showers a week, and the
Review report of the General Commanding the Northern Army was
received: “A fine regiment, fit for service.” But it was a trying
time, as an Indian hot weather in the plains always is. India is a
picturesque country, full of beauty and romance for those who have
eyes to see, but it has its drawbacks. English women face them as
well as men. The following extracts are from the letters of a
lady who decided to brave the heat with the Regiment.</p>

<p><i>February 15, 1912.</i>&mdash;“The weather has suddenly got very hot....
The Inter-Regimental week starts on the 4th of next month, and
goes on for about a fortnight. To feel I’ve got to entertain people
for a fortnight is a nightmare!&mdash;this place doesn’t suit me, and I
never feel well. At the last moment &mdash;&mdash; may be sent up to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
hills with the invalid party, but it doesn’t look like it, and he’s
not down for a day’s leave of any description.”</p>

<p><i>February 21, 1912.</i>&mdash;“We have heard nothing about the Regiment
being moved this year, so I suppose we shall stay on here. I have
decided to try and stick out the hot weather with &mdash;&mdash;. I should
like to have come home, but if I do &mdash;&mdash; won’t go away at all by
himself, and if I have to go away and go somewhere to a hill
station he will come too if he can get any leave. Of course every
one tells me that no woman can do a hot weather here, but I
shall try....”</p>

<p><i>April 3.</i>&mdash;“We have had a nice cool week, for which everybody
is very thankful. There was a terrific thunderstorm at the
end of last week, and the temperature dropped from 103 to 83,
so you can imagine it was a change. We all shivered, but it was
lovely. It is warming up again now, and the last two days have
been 100 or over in the shade in the middle of the day.</p>

<p>“The early routine has started now and &mdash;&mdash; has to be up at
4.45, and gets done about 10.30, when he comes in and has
breakfast. We generally lie down in the afternoon and try and
sleep, getting up about 4 for tea, before going to polo or playing
tennis. Nearly every one has gone away on leave, and the place
is very empty and desolate.”</p>

<p><i>April 18.</i>&mdash;“There is no news to tell you from here&mdash;the
hot weather is always a dreary time of forced inaction and
perpetual discomfort. We are sleeping out of doors every night
now with no sheets or blankets to cover us, so you can imagine
it is pretty warm. One generally falls into a dead sleep just before
the dawn, which is the only cool time during the twenty-four
hours. I change my clothes five times during the day&mdash;it is one
form of exercise. We are both keeping fit, which is the great
thing....</p>

<p>“We had a terrific sandstorm here on Tuesday. We could
see it coming for miles as the sky was a bright yellow; unfortunately
we were caught in it as we were out driving; it was filthy,
and we got covered from head to foot with sand. The storm
lasted two hours, but we didn’t get a drop of rain. If only we
had had some rain it would have been cooler for a few days.”</p>

<p>So it went on for many months longer, through the blazing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
hot weather and the sultry depressing rains. Then began another
cold season.</p>

<p class="caption">THE ESCORT AT AGRA. 1ST AND 3RD TROOPS OF SQUADRON D</p></div>

<p>On the 1st November the Thirteenth won the final in the Meerut
Polo Tournament, after a desperate struggle with the King’s
Dragoon Guards. An officer of the Regiment who had been
studying the more scientific parts of his profession left for the
Staff College at Camberley.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> There was a Cavalry concentration
camp, where a considerable mounted force was assembled for
Divisional training, followed by manœuvres of several Divisions
together. In the midst of all this soldier work the year was closed
by an incident which startled and shocked India. It had been
arranged that on the 23rd of December the Viceroy, Lord
Hardinge, was to make a State entry into the new capital, and
some of the Thirteenth had been sent to join in the ceremonial. The
Regimental Diary records very briefly that “a dastardly outrage
occurred, a bomb being thrown at the Viceroy, which resulted in
his serious injury.” It was a painful commentary upon the
enthusiastic greeting which had been given to the King-Emperor
on the same spot just a year before, and a reminder that in India
there exists always a root of sedition and danger which must not
be disregarded. Peace in India is armed vigilance. But happily
disloyal sentiment is confined to a small minority, and the heart of
the great Empire is sound. So Englishmen felt. They showed a fine
example of coolness and moderation in face of the treacherous attempt
at murder, and all went on again as before. If the traitors had
expected to intimidate the white man they were wholly mistaken.</p>

<p>On the 1st of January 1913, ceremonial parades were as usual
held throughout the country to celebrate the assumption by Queen
Victoria, more than thirty years before, of the title of Empress
of India, and over the momentarily troubled waters the ship of
Empire sailed forward undisturbed upon its stately way.</p>

<p>During the rest of the year there was from the point of view of
the Thirteenth nothing of much importance to record. The Regimental
Diary mentions that the English system of messing was introduced
for the first time in India; that “C” Squadron won a silver challenge
cup for shooting open to all squadrons, batteries, and companies
in the Division; and that there was a short spell of “experimental
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
training” in camp, when the Regiment lived entirely on the
resources of the neighbouring country. Beyond these incidents,
the Diary touches upon little but the doings of the men at cricket
and boxing, and “skill-at-arms” competitions, and hockey and
football tournaments. Hot work they must have been, for there
is this entry referring to the months of July and August: “During
these two months the average temperature was about 98. The
weather was very trying and injurious to health, mainly due to
the rain, followed immediately by sunshine, which caused vapours
to rise from the ground.” To every one who has served in India
this quaintly worded sentence brings back a familiar picture. The
British soldier who has “heard the r&eacute;veill&eacute; from Birr to Bareilly”
knows only too well the dreariness of the late summer, when the
faces of the women and children grow white in the reek from the
rain-sodden ground.</p>

<p>On the 25th of October, Balaclava Day, the first “Old Comrades
Dinner” was held in London, and the Diary notes that among
those present were two Balaclava veterans.</p>

<p>With this month of October 1913, began the last working
season of the old order. Everything then seemed peaceful enough,
and no one thought that before a year had passed England would
be fighting desperately in the greatest war of all time. For the
Thirteenth Hussars attention was focussed on the usual incidents of
an Indian “cold weather.” The Diary records that the regimental
machine-gun detachment distinguished itself at the Meerut Rifle
Meeting by winning a match open to all India, and that there
were some tactical field-days with V Battery of the Horse
Artillery. The Regiment was to be associated with V Battery in
much hard fighting before they had done with each other. Finally,
at the close of the cold season, the Commander-in-Chief in India
came down to Meerut, and there was a “Garrison Ceremonial
Parade,” in which the Thirteenth took part. All went well with
them, and the inspection was entirely satisfactory. It was the
last they were to undergo before being tested by the ordeal of war.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1914 came the fateful news of the murders
at Serajevo, and before long it began to be seen that events were
tending towards a great European conflict into which England
might possibly be drawn. Every one remembers the excitement
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
of the month that followed. In India, as elsewhere all over the
world, it was intense. After so many years of peace, or at all
events so many years in which England had looked on at European
wars without bearing any part in them, it was difficult for
Englishmen to believe that the long-standing German menace
had really come to a head, and that “The Day” was upon us.
It seemed more probable that England would again stand aside,
and that whatever the Continental nations might do, no British
Army would be sent to shed its blood on European battlefields.
Even when Germany turned upon France, and it became certain
that we should see war close to our own shores&mdash;war by which
our own deepest interests must be endangered&mdash;it seemed doubtful
whether England would take upon herself the tremendous responsibility
of throwing her sword into the scale. Until the 4th of
August the issue remained in suspense. Then the doubt came to
an end, and on the following day it was known all over the British
Empire that the old country had chosen the path of honour.</p>

<p>In no part of the Empire had the suspense been more acute
than in India, which was full of martial traditions, and, in spite
of local treason here and there, full also of goodwill to the British
Crown. The sudden knowledge that Great Britain was at war stilled
at once the voice of sedition, and was the signal for an outburst
of loyalty on the part of Chiefs and people which astonished our
enemies, if not ourselves, though it was no new thing;<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> and it need
hardly be said that in the military cantonments scattered over the
face of the country, where the soldiers of the King’s Army, British
and Indian, were gathered in constant readiness for war, the
announcement was received with joy and eager hope. They might
not be privileged to join in the central conflict on the battlefields
of Europe, but surely they would have some share in the fighting,
some chance of service and honour.</p>

<p>Meerut was no exception, and among all the King’s Regiments
there was none which looked forward to the war more eagerly and
hopefully than the Thirteenth, with its memories of the Peninsula and
Waterloo and Balaclava. Some days before war was declared all
officers on leave in the country had been urgently recalled, and

when on the 5th of August the Regiment learnt from a telegram
to the Meerut Club that the sword had been drawn, it was ready
for immediate service. On the 9th of August the Meerut Division
was ordered to mobilise. Then followed some weeks of anxiety,
during which the Thirteenth were alternately elated and cast down
by contradictory rumours. Early in September they received orders
to prepare a large draft of men and horses for the Eighth Hussars,
which threw them into the depths of depression; then they got, but
could hardly rely upon, private reports that they were not to be
left in India. It was a trying time.</p>

<p>Meanwhile it had been raining hard, and this added to the
general depression. Polo became impossible, and neither officers
nor men had anything to relieve the tedium of waiting. The following
extracts from the letters of a junior officer may be worth quoting:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lieutenant G. R. Watson Smyth&mdash;August 9-12.</i>&mdash;“I do not know
whether this letter will ever reach you, or where I shall be if it
does. At the present moment we are awaiting the order to mobilise:
it is sure to arrive at any moment now if the Regiment is to go on
service. We don’t know if it is decided to take the Meerut Cavalry
Brigade, but ... it is possible that the infantry of the Division may
be taken. Whether they will be taken to garrison Egypt or to fight
at home is another matter. As I said, though, we are just waiting
for the telegraphic order before we start shoeing our horses and
sharpening our swords....</p>

<p>“It is now two and a half hours since we should have got our
orders, and I am beginning to fear that we shall not get them....</p>

<p>“I have just gone to the Club, and a wire has come in saying
that the Brigade is not for it. Rotten luck....</p>

<p>“The Native Regiments here are in a sort of fever of excitement,
and are longing to have a go at somebody....</p>

<p>“Skinner’s Horse are in Meerut with us now. They are an extraordinarily
good and very sporting lot.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></p>

<p>“There has only been one day’s polo for the last month, as all
the grounds are under water, and the rain never stopped long enough
to let them dry....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span></p>

<p><i>August 30.</i>&mdash;“We are carrying on in the same way as if there
were no war in the world.... It really is a bit too thick that
here are we, the most efficient Cavalry in the world, stuck in this
horrid country.... Not a hope of our going to war. We have
just heard that they are mobilising three other Brigades, and that
the Viceroy is coming with the Court to live at Meerut this cold
weather. His escort is one British Cavalry and one British Infantry
Regiment with a battery of horse guns. This means that we shall
stay here and do escort to him the whole time that the war
is on....”</p>

<p><i>September 17.</i>&mdash;“We are becoming deadened to joy or sorrow.
It is a perfectly horrible existence, and unfortunately there is no
hope of its changing for the better.</p>

<p>“We have had six inches of rain since midnight, and it is still
raining&mdash;the country will probably be flooded....</p>

<p>“There is a small polo tournament coming off here next week;
it ought to give us something to think about, but I am afraid that
no one can raise any enthusiasm about anything, as we are all
bored stiff.”</p>

<p><i>October 8.</i>&mdash;“There is as usual nothing to say this mail except
that our chances of getting out look blacker than ever....</p>

<p>“I think I told you that we have been having a little polo
tournament on the American system. I am glad to say that we
won it....</p>

<p>“We are going into camp with the squadron on Saturday for
a fortnight. It will be bad, but a lot better than barracks.”</p>

<p><i>October 12.</i>&mdash;“I am writing this in our squadron camp....
We have made friends with the local Nabob, and he has lent us
an elephant to go out shooting on. It is rather fun shooting off
his back, as one never knows what the next shot will be at: it
may be a buck or quail or partridge or snipe, or anything. He is
a jolly good retriever and will pick up anything that is dead, but
he hates to if it is only wounded.... The old man who lent
us the hathi (elephant), has just come in to complain that two
of our men have shot two peacocks, which are sacred birds to Hindus.
As there are very strict orders against shooting peacocks ... I
hope that they get it in the neck. They are both in my troop.”</p>

<p>That is an old cause of trouble. The British soldier finds it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
hard to resist at times the temptation to shoot a wild peacock,
and add a “turkey” to his rations; but the Government of India
is rightly strict on the subject. It is an instance of the care one
has to take to avoid hurting Indian feelings.</p>

<p><i>India, October 25, 1914.</i>&mdash;“As perhaps you may guess from the
above vague address, we are off to the war.... We got the order
at 4 <small>A.M.</small> ... to pack up and come in to barracks at once as the
Regiment was mobilising. We had everything packed up by 5 <small>A.M.</small>,
and the squadron left at 5.30. Considering that this was all done
in the dark and that it was raining as well, I think that it is rather
a good show.... They limit our kit to 35 lbs., which is only two
blankets, a change of clothes, an extra pair of boots, and a valise
to carry the lot&mdash;not very much to sleep in with a temperature of
20 or 30....</p>

<p>“It is rather a coincidence that we got the order to mobilise
on Balaclava day, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Balaclava day! Sixty years had passed, and the thought of it
was still ready to the minds of those who were now taking the
Regiment into another war. That is what a feat of arms in which
his Regiment shared means to the soldier&mdash;an ever-living memory
and example.</p>

<p>The suspense was over. “It is great news,” wrote the Captain
commanding the squadron, “far better than we dared hope for,
and you may imagine how we are all feeling.” He was the same
officer who had commanded the Queen’s escort three years before&mdash;the
model escort. Now he was going to show whether the men
who had won so much admiration in a pageant of peace time
would do equally well in the field.</p>

<p>Nothing remained but to complete the number of men and horses,
both now below strength in consequence of the draft lately sent to
the Eighth Hussars, and to make the final arrangements for a quick
departure. Men and horses were found from other regiments, and
during the first ten days of November the packing and preparations
were completed. Officers disposed of their horses and furniture;
many of the polo ponies were taken over by the Remount Department
for service as Infantry officers’ chargers; the regimental mess was
closed; the heavy baggage and valuable books were sent to England;
and the Regiment’s period of peace service in India was at an end.

<span class="large">THE INDIAN ARMY&mdash;BEGINNING OF WAR.</span></h2>

<p>The Empire of India, with its population of more than three
hundred millions, is held by an army which, compared with the
hosts of European nations, is a small one. Great Britain has never
had in India much more than seventy thousand British troops, not
one man to four thousand of the population&mdash;a conclusive proof,
if any were needed, of the fact that British rule in India is based
rather on the goodwill of the Indians than on force. No doubt
in the last resort the white soldier is the mainstay of the Government
against sedition and revolt; but if sedition and revolt were
ever more than partial they would need a much larger garrison to
suppress them. Three hundred millions of people would not be
indefinitely “kept down” by an army of seventy thousand foreigners,
however brave and well disciplined. The truth is that the British
supremacy in India, though it has at times involved hard fighting,
was founded upon the consent and active co-operation of the
Indian races, and is maintained by the same means.</p>

<p>Not only is the number of British troops in India comparatively
small, but the British Government has not feared to raise and keep
up alongside of them an army of Indian regular troops twice as
strong, and to arm and make efficient for war other bodies of men
drawn from the population, notably some fine contingents of
soldiery in the Feudatory chiefships. Altogether it may perhaps
be roughly computed that at the outbreak of the War in 1914 the
Crown had at its disposal in India, counting local volunteers,
perhaps a hundred thousand armed white men and two hundred
thousand Indians. This force had to maintain internal order
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
throughout a country as large as all Europe excluding Russia,
and to defend the frontiers against any aggression from without.
It was regarded, and organised, not as two armies sundered by the
colour-line and mutually suspicious of one another, but as one
army in which the white regiments and Indian regiments served
side by side, as they had served for many generations in many
wars, mutually trusting one another and fighting as comrades
against any enemy who might threaten the interests of the Indian
Empire.</p>

<p>Some of these enemies had been fought at a great distance
from India&mdash;in China, in Persia, in Egypt, and in other countries
across the sea; but until now Indian troops had not been employed
in the battlefields of Europe. More than a hundred years before
a great “sepoy General,” who had learnt his trade in India,
had commanded British armies against the soldiers of Napoleon;
and countless other British officers and men had served both in
India and Europe. India had, in fact, to quote Henderson’s
‘Science of War,’ been “the great training-ground” of the British
Army. And Indian troops had at times, in Asia and Africa, crossed
swords with European enemies. Nevertheless, the Indian Army, as
such, had not fought in Europe, and the British officers who
commanded Indian soldiers had not often served, even individually,
in European wars. No Indian soldiery fought in the Peninsular
War, or at Waterloo, or in the Crimea, or even in the Boer War,
though a contingent of white troops from India did go out to
South Africa then, and saved Natal. England, in fact, had
hitherto regarded the Indian Army, and the vast reserves of Indian
races on which that Army could draw, as a source of strength only
for her outlying wars, not as a portion of the Imperial power
upon which she could rely if attacked in Europe. That may be
said in spite of the fact that on one occasion the far-sighted
Beaconsfield had as a demonstration brought a few Indian troops
to the Mediterranean.</p>

<p class="caption">EMBARKING AT BOMBAY. NOVEMBER 1914</p></div>

<p>Unluckily, it may be observed here, this view, and other reasons,
prevented the Indian Army in recent times from being brought up
to the mark required for scientific warfare in Europe. While
the Home Army was being modernised and improved in every way
after the Sudan campaigns and the Boer War, the Indian Army
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
was left without similar attention. It was quite fit for Asiatic
warfare, but in training, arms, and equipment, its splendid officers
and men found themselves at a great disadvantage when employed
against European troops of the latest model.</p>

<p>This, however, was not understood by Great Britain.</p>

<p>Now that she found herself involved in a conflict with the
greatest military power the world has ever seen, and woefully
short of British troops in England to support the comparatively
small force she could send to the help of France, her eyes turned to
her great dependency; and fully assured of the loyalty of India,
in spite of the seditious movements of the past few years, she
decided to make use of the reserve of trained strength she had
hitherto set aside, and to let the Army in India, British and Indian,
have its share in fighting the common enemy on European soil.
It was a bold decision, full of important consequences for India
and for the Empire; but it was taken, and the call was sent out.</p>

<p>So, when the Thirteenth Hussars received their orders for the
front, they were summoned not as an individual Regiment of British
Cavalry, but as part of the Meerut Cavalry Brigade, made up of
one British and two Indian Regiments, the 3rd and 18th. This
Brigade in its turn formed part of an Indian Cavalry Division,
the 2nd, and the 2nd Division formed part of an Indian Cavalry
Corps.</p>

<p>On the 13th of November the Thirteenth left Meerut by train, in
three detachments, and went down to Bombay, where they were to
embark. What their destination was they did not know for
certain, but it was believed to be somewhere west of Suez. As
a fact, their destination was Marseilles, but during the two days
they remained in Bombay waiting to embark, they received no
definite news of this.</p>

<p>Bombay, the great western port of India, with its magnificent
harbour and wooded hills and teeming city, was at this time a very
busy scene. It had originally come to Charles II. as a portion of
the dowry of Catherine of Braganza, and had been transferred by
him to the East India Company for an annual payment of &pound;10,
a striking exemplification of the almost magical development of the
British Empire in India. Now it was of great value as a commercial
port, and as the harbour from which the Indian Government was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
to carry on the activities entailed by the war. But a Regiment
embarking for service had little time for thinking of such matters,
for there was much to be done in the two days that elapsed
before the troops went on board. On the 17th of November
everything was ready, and the embarkation began. Many of the
horses were piteously frightened at their novel experience, some
of them “screaming like children” as they were slung up into the
air and lowered into the hold; but they soon got over their terror,
and the men worked splendidly in the Indian heat, the sweat
streaming down their faces and through their coats. Before night
men and horses were all safely on board, and there had been
no mishaps.</p>

<p>The strength of the Regiment when it embarked, under the
command of Lieut.-Colonel Symons, was 20 officers,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> including the
Medical Officer, 499 other ranks, including the Assistant-Surgeon,
560 horses, and 1 pony. Several officers were on leave in England,
and some of them were expected to join later; but others had
already gone to the Front, of whom 2 had been killed and 2 wounded.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a>
The Regiment was distributed in two transports&mdash;Headquarters
and three squadrons, “A,” “B,” and “D,” on board the <i>Dunluce
Castle</i>, “C” Squadron and the machine-gun detachment on board
the <i>Risaldar</i>. During the 18th of November the vessels remained
at anchor, for they were to form part of a convoy, and some of the
other ships were not quite ready to sail; but on the 19th all was in
order, and then at 9 o’clock in the morning the whole convoy, to
the number of 26, weighed anchor and steamed slowly out over the
sunlit waters of the harbour. Outside, the convoy stopped to pick
up a few more ships joining from another port, and then the whole
formed up, six abreast, and, led by an escorting cruiser, sailed away
to the westward. It was a fine sight, though a sad one for the
women of the Regiment, who were left behind on shore. Many
of them had looked their last upon their men. But that is war.</p>

<p class="caption">THE DEPARTURE FROM BOMBAY. 19TH NOVEMBER 1914</p></div>

<p>It was a striking incident that the convoy was escorted from
Bombay by the <i>Dupleix</i>, a French man-of-war. In the old days,
when the French and English were fighting out their long struggle
for the mastery of India, the English had no more dangerous
enemy than Dupleix, who tried to raise against them a confederacy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
of Indian powers, and as some believe taught them the use of
Indian soldiery trained after the manner of Europe. Sea-power,
which he did not understand, baffled all his efforts and decided the
struggle in favour of England. Now, if the spirit of the great
Frenchman had returned to the shores of India, he would have
seen the same sea-power again triumphantly exerted, and would
have watched his own countrymen, in a vessel which bore his
name, joining with his old enemies to convey to the shores of
France, for the help of France, thousands of Indian soldiery drilled
and disciplined after his own fashion. If he could have gone with
them he might have seen another and even more striking example
of the irony of fate. He might have seen on the shores of the
Channel the figure of another and greater Frenchman, looking
down from his lofty column, not upon the ranks of his veterans
gathered together for the invasion of England, but upon the tents
of numberless British encampments full of Englishmen assembled
on French soil to fight for France. A hundred years before,
English sea-power had foiled his vast schemes of conquest. “Those
far-distant, storm-beaten ships upon which the Grand Army never
looked, stood between it and the dominion of the world.” And they
had prevailed. Now English sea-power was fighting on the side of
the Army of France, and the old enemies combined were to bring
down in ruin another scheme of universal empire.

<span class="large">VOYAGE TO FRANCE.</span></h2>

<p>The voyage of the Thirteenth across the Indian Ocean was not disturbed
by any hostile attack or demonstration, nor by bad weather, and
the six-abreast formation was kept until the convoy was near Aden,
when a new formation in two lines ahead, or two ships abreast,
was taken up. Shortly after passing Aden the <i>Dupleix</i> parted company
to coal at the French port of Jibuti, and her place was taken
by the <i>Northbrook</i>, a vessel of the Royal Indian Marine. So far all
had gone well.</p>

<p>The wife of an officer of the Thirteenth had left Bombay for
England in a passenger steamer a day or two after the Regiment, and
she writes in a letter of the time: “On Saturday, 28th of November,
we caught sight of our Indian convoy at about nine in the morning.
An Admiral asked the Captain to go quite close, as there were so
many wives on board whose husbands were in the convoy. So he
very kindly altered his course, and we went quite close so that we
were able to pick out the different ships, and could actually through
glasses see the ships with horses on board.” It was a courteous
act, and no doubt gave pleasure, if a rather pathetic pleasure, to
all concerned.</p>

<p class="caption">IN THE SUEZ CANAL. DECEMBER 1914</p></div>

<p>Though matters had gone well, the voyage had not been altogether
without suffering for man and beast. Even at the best
season of the year the heat in the Eastern seas can be very trying,
and though British troops going on service were no longer exposed
to the horrible discomforts of Crimean days, but conveyed in such
splendid vessels as those of the Union-Castle Line, the Thirteenth had
some unpleasant times. An officer wrote to his wife: “You know
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
what the weather has been like, but you can have no conception of
what it has been below in the horse decks: absolute hell. All
across the Arabian Sea it was dead calm and a following wind,
and the first day and a half in the Red Sea was even worse. We
have worked like slaves with the horses, off and on all day: men
stripped, officers in shirt sleeves, and all pouring with sweat; the
horses panting for breath, and all we could do by continually
moving them, sluicing with vinegar and water, and all sorts of
things, to keep them alive. It was heart-breaking. I hope I’ll
never go through such a time again.... All the days in the
Arabian Sea seemed to get hotter and hotter, and the horses worse
and worse; and the first day in the Red Sea, last Friday the 20th,
was worse still, and one of my best horses, No. 133, 4th Troop, a
nice bay from Saugar, with pink rings round his eyes, died from
heat-stroke. Then one of ‘B’ Squadron died, and it was desperate.
Two or three times they have had the ship round in a circle, to
face the wind and try and get some air below for the horses, and
it has been a great relief.... You wouldn’t believe how tame all
the horses are now. You can do anything with them. Poor devils,
they have had a frightful time. Saturday again was very hot, but
the wind gradually came round ahead, and by evening there was
a good breeze; and yesterday and to-day has been lovely: a stiff
breeze ahead and quite cool. It is like heaven, and the horses
are like different creatures and picking up fast. It is sure to last
now, I think, right in to Suez, and I hope our troubles are
over.... The men have worked like slaves, and so have we for
that matter.”</p>

<p>Another officer, Lieutenant Watson Smyth, writes of the start
at Bombay, after five or six hours spent in slinging horses into the
hold: “At 8.30 I went down to the horse deck, and never have I
met such heat. The horses were packed in pens of five, and were
all, all over in a white lather; The temperature was taken by the
Vet. and it was 133. This is 6 degrees more than the highest
recorded in India, so you can see it was real hot....”</p>

<p><i>November 29, 1914.</i>&mdash;“It has been very hot indeed the last few days,
and the horses are feeling it very much. Only two have died so
far.... I think I said that most of my squadron are in the fore-hold,
and the other squadrons are on the decks above it round the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
hatchway, so that if anything has to be taken out of their decks by
a crane it has to be hung over the hold while being hoisted. One
of the horses I mentioned died in one of their decks, and when
slung up to be dropped overboard, slipped out of the sling and fell
forty feet into the hold. Luckily he only grazed one of our horses,
another half-inch and it would have been killed. I have decided to
take that horse for a charger, as if he can have an escape like that
nothing else is likely to hurt him.”</p>

<p>It was a rough experience, and not a very good preparation for
the cold of a winter in Northern France; but for the moment the
discomfort was over, and throughout the voyage not many horses
died. The Thirteenth lost four or five in all. Three-quarters of the
troop horses were Indian country-breds, and the rest Australians,
and therefore also accustomed to some heat. But the country-breds
were rather light for British Cavalry, and hardly fitted at
best to face snow and wet.</p>

<p>The Thirteenth found the banks of the Suez Canal lined with
troops, largely Indian, who were expecting an attack from the Turkish
army gathered in the desert to the north, but no attack came while
the convoy was in the Canal.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, though still ignorant of their destination and very
anxious to know it, they were cheered by a letter from an officer
who had seen some fighting on the French Front. “He says the
German Cavalry won’t face ours at all, and that their Infantry
shoot rottenly. He says their Artillery, machine-guns, aeroplanes&mdash;anything
mechanical, in fact&mdash;are perfect&mdash;and nearly all the
casualties are from gun-fire. He says, man for man they are no
match for us, and it is all simply a question of numbers. He says
the patrol-work of the German Cavalry is too childish.” This confident
letter was not altogether wrong in its views, as was afterwards
shown by Lord French’s despatches and other evidence.
Needless to say, the Thirteenth longed to be face to face with the
famous Uhlans.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<p class="caption">IN THE SUEZ CANAL. DECEMBER 1914</p></div>

<p>Port Said was full of troops and of French cruisers and destroyers,
a very bright and busy scene. There the Thirteenth at last learnt
their destination. What they had longed for had come. They were to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
go on to Marseilles, and from there to the Western Front. It was
to be real work, against a European enemy.</p>

<p>The passage across the Mediterranean, if rough, was uneventful,
and by the middle of December the Regiment was landed on
French soil. “We have arrived all fit and well and jolly,”
Captain Eve wrote, “and have had a very busy day.... It is
beautifully mild and fine. All the horses are well, and mine
flourishing.”</p>

<p>The next day the Regiment went on by rail to Orleans. It was
an interesting journey, and the French people all along the line
gave the Regiment a hearty welcome. “French Red Cross people
at all large stations, and lots of soldiers: also lots of enthusiasm,
singing, giving the men country wine, and so on. They gave us
cigarettes, coffee, tea, flowers, and so on, and were all very nice.
Altogether it was very interesting and I enjoyed it. I had to give
one badge away to a girl who asked for it, and to kiss another’s
hand, which I hated. The men made a tremendous noise, but
behaved very well indeed, except that two or three of mine got
rather drunk on the last night. But it was very difficult for
them. I find I can get on a little with my French if I am not
hurried....”</p>

<p>That entry was very English, and very English too the thoughts
of hunting stirred up by the French <i>campagne</i>: “We came a round-about
way, not straight, and at one part came through some
awfully nice country just like home, say the Duke’s country, enclosed
property, and some stone-wall country too, and small
coverts, and hilly. I got quite excited looking out at it.”</p>

<p>But the journey was soon over. A little after midnight, on the
17th of December, the Regiment arrived at a siding near their
camp: “It was bitterly cold, with a white frost and icy wind, and
we had to turn out, detrain, and load up all our kit, saddles, and
arms on to motor lorries, and then march, leading our horses six
miles out to our camp here in pitch darkness.... We left the
station about 2.45 <small>A.M.</small>, and reached camp about 5 <small>A.M.</small>, and groped
about till we somehow got our lines down.” It was not a pleasant
beginning to their soldiering in France, a curious contrast to the
heat of the Red Sea&mdash;“the worst and coldest camp, I think, I have

exposed hill, with a bitter wind blowing. We are in tents, V.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a>
and I sharing an 80-lb. one. We are very warm and comfortable,
lots of warm straw on the ground, and our valises on top of it, and
the men are in tents too, but the poor unfortunate horses are
having a terrible time.... They stand always in a bog. The
watering-place, about three-quarters of a mile away, is literally up
to your knees nearly in liquid mud.” Lance-Corporal Bowie’s diary
says of the arrival at Orleans: “Here we detrained at once in the
midst of a terrific hailstorm, afterwards saddling up and leading our
horses through the city to the village of La-Source, a distance of
nine miles. Our stay at this camp proved to be a very severe test
for both men and horses, as we were still clothed in our Indian
khaki; at the same time it rained heavily for hours, and was also
bitterly cold. The place in which the rough water-troughs had
been fitted up, being in a valley, became practically a sea of mud,
in places reaching up to our horses’ bellies.”</p>

<p>At this camp the Regiment found some more of their officers
awaiting them, which brought them up to full strength again.</p>

<p>After two or three days they moved to a slightly more sheltered
place, and the weather began to change. By Christmas Day it
was bitterly cold, but bright and still, with a warm sun, and all
was going better. Plenty of warm clothing was being served out
to the men, and it was possible to get exercise again; and the
food was excellent, good meat and vegetables, and tobacco. The
warm clothing indeed was more than the men and horses could
carry, and the quantity of blankets and other things had to be reduced
to a more reasonable and serviceable scale. To quote Lance-Corporal
Bowie again: “On Christmas Day 1914, every one received
a post-card photo of the King and Queen, and also a gift from
Princess Mary, which consisted of a pipe and an embossed brass
box containing tobacco and cigarettes. A majority of us also
received a Christmas parcel, which we owed to the generosity of
the ladies connected with the Regiment, at the same time being
completely overloaded with warm underwear, woollen cardigans,
waistcoats, mittens, &amp;c. But the waste of our new kits which we
were compelled to obtain before leaving India was disgraceful,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
almost everything being burnt with the exception of some which
we had dumped at Marseilles, which, needless to say, we never saw
again. On the morning of the 31st of December we were all very
glad to march out of this muddy camp, an incident worthy of
note being that the men were so overloaded with kit (many of
them having on two of almost everything as regards underclothing,
having nowhere else to carry it), that they found it an awful struggle
to mount, feeling more like a well-dressed Christmas-tree than a
cavalryman. However, having all got mounted, we marched direct
to Orleans Station, where we at once entrained for Berguette
(Pas-de-Calais), where we arrived at 3 <small>A.M.</small> on 1st January 1915.
Detraining here, we marched up to a village called Enquin-les-Mines,
a distance of some kilometres, where we were allotted
billets which consisted of old barns, &amp;c., for the men, whilst we
made our horses comfortable under archways, &amp;c.”</p>

<p>Certainly the British soldier in this war was equipped and fed
as he had never been before, and the Thirteenth ended the year
very happily on the whole. It was a contrast to their winter in
the Crimea sixty years earlier.</p>

<p>Christmas good wishes and photographs from the King and
Queen and Princess Mary came to assure them that they were not
forgotten in England. And if the prayer of Their Majesties, “May
God protect you and bring you home safe!” was not to be fulfilled
for all of them, they faced what was to come with confidence and
eagerness, longing only for more stirring work, and a chance of
doing their share of honourable service.</p>

<p>It was a pause in the fighting then. The great retreat on
Paris and the battle of the Marne were over, and the baffled enemy
had made his first attempt to strike out to the westward for the
Channel ports. He had been stopped after desperate fighting by
the wasted regiments of our little army, and the troops on both
sides were settling down into the long trench warfare of the next
four years. The British part of the line was woefully short of men,
and guns and munitions of all kinds; and to those who knew the
real state of affairs the outlook was very dark, for in England there
were no trained reserves to send to the Front&mdash;plenty of brave
men, but no soldiers. Happily the country did not know in what
peril its army was, and contingents were coming from India and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
Canada and Australia and New Zealand, and the confidence of the
men at the Front was unfailing, and all hoped that the worst was
over. It seems wonderful now that such confidence should have
prevailed at the Front, and so little real anxiety in England; but
the fighting men were full of the belief that they were man for man
so superior to the enemy that he could never break through. Such
gloomy faces as there were could be found only in England, not
among the fighting men. In spite of snow and mud and suffering
of all kinds, there was no gloom with them.</p>

<p>The Regiment was now at full strength, officers and men and horses,
and keen for a share in the fighting. The horses had suffered to
some extent from the change of climate in the past six weeks, but
only required a little rest and feeding-up. The men seemed fit
and ready for anything.</p>

<p>But though all hoped for Cavalry work in the near future, and
a chance at the Uhlans, this was not to come yet. The enemy’s
horsemen were no longer to be found in the extreme front, and
the fighting was being done by our guns and Infantry, which were
deficient in numbers and very hard pressed. The British Cavalry,
therefore, though kept as far as possible efficient for their own
work in case a chance should occur, had to be utilised to some
extent to help the out-numbered foot-soldiers in the trenches; and
during the first few days of the new year the officers and men of
the Thirteenth, while undergoing Cavalry inspection and training,
were hard at work perfecting themselves in their new duties. They
had not long to wait.</p>

<p>Before the middle of January they had been taken up to the
firing line to be “shot over.” “On the 12th,” writes Lance-Corporal
Bowie, “we were informed that we were to take our
places in the trenches as infantry, having been armed with the
new H. V. rifle and bayonet, and having had plenty of practice in
bayonet-fighting, which was quite a new thing for the Cavalry, we
were pretty confident of being able to do anything that was
required of us dismounted. So leaving only sufficient men behind
to attend to the horses, we started off the next morning in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
highest spirits for B&eacute;thune, our conveyances being the good old
London motor-buses, complete with their own drivers and conductors.
Arriving there at 5 <small>P.M.</small>, we marched direct to the
trenches, just in front of the village of Festubert, a distance of
thirteen kilometres, relieving the 6th Inniskilling Dragoons. We
remained in these trenches until 6 <small>P.M.</small> the following evening, when
we were relieved by the Oxford and Bucks Light Infantry, many
of our fellows having to be lifted out of the trenches owing to
being cramped with standing in the mud and water for so long.
On each man receiving a tot of rum, we at once marched back to
B&eacute;thune.... On arriving at the market square in B&eacute;thune, many
men fell from sheer exhaustion. Meeting the buses again, we had
some hot coffee and returned directly back to our billets, which we
were very thankful to reach about 2 <small>A.M.</small> on the 15th of January
1915. One of the most remarkable features of this, our first time
in the trenches, was the fact that we did not sustain a single
casualty, although we were subjected to a continual bombardment
the whole time, the Huns’ shooting being fairly good(?), but their
shells were very bad, many burying themselves in the mud and
failing to explode at all.”</p>

<p>Such was the first introduction of the Thirteenth to actual
fighting in the Great War. It was very different from what they
had hoped&mdash;a dreary struggle of endurance against mud and cold,
on foot, instead of the stirring hand-to-hand work in the saddle for
which a cavalryman naturally longs; but the account shows the
cheery spirit in which the men took to their uncongenial duty.
Needless to say, the officers set them a good example. One of
them, Lieutenant Watson Smyth (14th January 1915), writes: “We
got up at Enquingatte, where we were billeted, at 6 <small>A.M.</small> on
Wednesday, and at 8 had a three-mile march to another village,
Estr&eacute;e Blanche, where the whole Brigade was concentrated. At
about 10.30 along came a fleet of motor omnibuses (London General
Company), and halted along the line of troops. We were then
told off, and twenty-five men and one officer went in each bus.
The buses have the glass out of the windows and the space is
boarded up, otherwise they are the same, except that the outside
advertisements are painted over, and the whole bus is dark grey
(please excuse my writing, but we are under shell-fire&mdash;75 mm.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
shrapnel&mdash;and I am expecting one through the roof any minute).
To go on, we left in our buses at 11 <small>A.M.</small> Soon after starting, one
skidded into the ditch and had to be jacked and dug out, but this
got to be quite a common occurrence later in the trip. At about
1 <small>P.M.</small> we arrived at B&eacute;thune, about seven miles from the trenches.
We stayed there for an hour, and had our lunch while the men had
their dinners. At about 2.30 we got going again, this time on
our flat feet, and marched about four and a half miles to a village,
Festubert, where we halted. Here we all got a drink of beer,
followed by coffee and rum. At 4.45 <small>P.M.</small> we started again, and
this time went right on up to just behind the trenches. Here
I, with eight men who had volunteered for the job, went on to
----, about 400 yards in front of our machine-guns, which were
on the left of our line.... When I got up to it we were challenged
by the post of the Regiment that we were relieving, and then I
went up to them. I asked if they were all right. In a very
despondent voice he replied, ‘I’ve two men nearly dead with cold:
they are both unconscious, and I don’t know how I’ll get them
back.’ Just at that moment one more man went over flop. I
thought this was a jolly start, as I was going to be there all night
and these fellows had been there in the day. We had great trouble
to get them out, as the trench was knee-deep in the most holding
mud I had ever met. It beat Wadhurst clay by three stone and
a distance. Another difficulty was the fact that the Germans,
who were about 600 yards in front, or perhaps a bit more (people
are talking all round me, and I keep writing what I hear), kept on
sending up ‘Very’ lights and star-shells, which lit up the whole
place far better than it was lit up in the daytime. Owing to the
snipers, who were lying up all over the place, we had to drop flat
as soon as we saw the light going up, and stay there for about a
minute after it had gone. Then I got into the trench, which was
bisected by a stream which was just over knee-deep. I put four
men one side, and four with myself the near side. I had orders to
keep on sniping all night so as to annoy the Germans, so I had
one man of each four on sentry for an hour at a time, with orders
to shoot about once every five minutes. Of course I could not
sleep myself, but I lay down in the wet mud. The trench was
over ankle-deep in mud and water, and only just long enough to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
hold us all. About midnight it got most damnably cold, and I
issued the men milk chocolate, and gave them each a tot of rum
from a flask I’d got. The snipers kept on shooting at us, but
mostly went over, though a few bullets did hit the trench. One
horrid fellow, whom we called Bert, was behind us somewhere,
and made me very angry. At 3 <small>A.M.</small> we heard the devil of a
battle going on a long way off, machine-firing guns going rapid,
and a rattle of musketry. This went on for half an hour, and then
one or more of our big guns somewhere behind us started firing
occasional shots. It made a most colossal row, although it must
have been at least half a mile away. At about 5 <small>A.M.</small> we saw the
relief coming up, halted it and saw that it was all right, got out of the
trench, ... then we went back to the road behind us and walked
along it for about 500 yards till we came to the house that the
squadron was billeted in. There we got some tea and more rum,
and a bit of bully and biscuit, and the men thawed out. The
squadron had been in the trenches all night, and had been
relieved, as I was, just before dawn. I do not think I ever appreciated
a house and a fire so much before as after that twelve hours
of water and mud.... The dotted lines show where the snipers
were firing. There was one called Fritz who used to fire across
the road about every ten minutes. I am sending you one of his
bullets. We sat in the house until 10 <small>A.M.</small>, when the Germans
began to shell the place. The first shell (shrapnel out of captured
French guns) burst about 80 feet in front of a group of us, me
included, and the bullets went all round us without touching
anybody&mdash;it was really rather a lucky escape. After that we
cleared off to the bomb-proof at the back of the house where
I am now. Another shell burst as we were going into the shelter,
and scattered all round, but again missed everybody....”</p>

<p><i>January 15, 1915.</i>&mdash;“We are now back in billets, having done
only twenty-four hours in the trenches. We stayed in our bombproof
till about 3 <small>P.M.</small>, although they had stopped shelling the
village.... We found that two shells had gone through the
room we had been sitting in and had burst in it. They had only
knocked holes in the walls and scattered a lot of plaster and stuff
about. We had our transport packed by 4.30 <small>P.M.</small> and fell in at
5 in the dark.... I had to wait so as to take the patrol of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
the relieving regiment down to where I had been.... On the
way, up went a star-shell, and down I flopped in about six inches
of water. As soon as the light had gone&mdash;phut!&mdash;and a bullet from
Fritz hit the ground about 15 yards over. I lay a little flatter,
with my back crawling with apprehension&mdash;phut!&mdash;and another went
about 10 yards in front. I lay flatter still&mdash;phut!&mdash;and another
hit the ground about 10 yards behind. I thought this was nice, as
he must now be able to see me, and the next shot ought to get
me, so I lay very flat and cursed all Germans. But he didn’t
fire again, so after a bit I got up and splashed (I’ve never made
such a noise before, at least so I thought) forward to the patrol.
They also were so cold that they could hardly stand, so I had
to stand on the bank and lug them out to the usual accompaniment
of star-shell, Very lights, and snipers.... We got into our
billets at 3 <small>A.M.</small>, and I was in bed and asleep at 3.20. We were
all in a most filthy mess outside, owing to the mud and water
that we had been lying in, and inside our clothes owing to the
cod-liver oil that we were anointed with from our feet up to our
waists.... It is fine stuff to keep the cold out. I was wearing
Cording boots with two pairs of socks, the inside pair vaselined,
and the outside pair oiled, and puttees over the top of the boots.
Although I had been several times in water over my knees, I
never got my feet cold or wet.... The only casualty in the
Brigade was one sowar of the &mdash;&mdash;, killed. He got scared at a
Very light, and stood up in the open staring at it, so of course a
sniper shot him and he died. I don’t expect we shall do any more
trenches for a bit: this effort was only due to the Corps Commander,
who wanted to have us shot over. I think it did every one a lot
of good: it has certainly taught me that shrapnel is not half so
awful as one thinks, and that one can lie out with only a coat on
in a puddle all through a winter night, and be none the worse for it,
and also that a whack of rum has an entirely beneficial effect.”</p>

<p><i>January 16.</i>&mdash;“The patrol of the Regiment that relieved
mine saw two dead Germans about 500 feet in front, and so of
course all the men who were with me are claiming that they killed
them, and the first blood of the Regiment is theirs.... The men
I had with me were all hard nuts, and when not on sentry lay
down in the water and went to sleep. They had their British
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
warms (<i>i.e.</i>, coats with a flannel lining that reaches to the knee)
and mackintoshes, so that they were fairly warm and dry, except
for their legs. Their feet got very cold, though the vaseline helped
a lot.... It was quite an experience, and although I was most
beastly uncomfortable all the time, I wouldn’t have missed it for
anything. I must say that I never expected that the first time
people fired shots in anger at me, and I was retaliating, that my
only thought would be how to keep warm, and also not to go to
sleep.... One rather amusing thing happened while we were in
reserve in the village. Our Colonel got an idea that a sniper was
concealed in one of the houses (there were no inhabitants left), and
so ordered ‘X’ Squadron to make a house-to-house search. A party
consisting of twenty men and one young officer started off with
loaded rifles, fixed bayonets, fingers on the trigger&mdash;officers waving
revolvers. Suddenly they saw a man on a haystack: immediately
pandemonium ensued&mdash;rifles going rapid, men charging, revolvers
going off, wild confusion. Suddenly the fire stopped, and a perfectly
<i>furious</i> officer leaped off the haystack, rushed at the officer,
and started, ‘You ... ’ for about five minutes. He then saw the
squadron leader, rushed at him, and dragged him off to the Colonel.
He then said he’d been on that haystack for five weeks, that all the
Germans in Northern France had been shooting at him, as he was
in an extraordinarily good place for observing fire, and then these
---- did their best&mdash;a d&mdash;d poor one at only 20 yards&mdash;to lay him
out. As we had not been warned he was there, I think it was
quite natural to plug him. He really was the angriest man I have
ever seen.”</p>

<p>War has its humours, and it is well to be able to enjoy them.</p>

<p>For a month or so after that first experience there seem to have
been no more nights in the front trenches for the Thirteenth, but
some parties were told off for trench-digging, and there was much
Cavalry-training of one kind or another, with occasional orders to
“stand to” and be ready to move at very short notice. These
orders of course gave rise at first to much excitement, and eager
hopes of some real Cavalry-fighting, but they never came to anything.
Perhaps the best way of showing what the Regiment was
doing during the remainder of this year, 1915, is to quote some
more extracts from letters and diaries.</p>

<p><i>Lieutenant Watson Smyth&mdash;February 6.</i>&mdash;“When I got back
I found my squadron ‘standing to,’ and ready to move at
fifteen minutes’ notice. However, that has now been cancelled, and
we are now living in the same old peaceable way. We had a sham
fight this morning to practise dismounted action. I and my troop
had to run along a dry stream-bed for about three-quarters of a
mile. I was nearly dead at the end of it, but my troop were even
more done, so on the whole I was rather pleased.... I do not
think it is likely that we shall move for some time, as it is
absolutely impossible for Cavalry to move once they get off the
roads.... I have just finished my evening task of letter censoring.
That is not a nice job as it takes a long time, and I don’t
much care about reading other people’s letters, especially such
extraordinarily dull ones as the average soldier writes.”</p>

<p><i>February 17.</i>&mdash;“In the afternoon it began to snow, and it
snowed as hard as it could all the evening and most of the night.
We had been going to have a Divisional route-march the next day
(Thursday), but that night the orders were cancelled. On Thursday
we found it just possible to ride our horses, but only just as the
roads were deep in snow, and it was balling badly.... We are
rather badly off for water in these billets: I do not mean that there
is not enough&mdash;the whole place is soaking&mdash;but none of it is very
good. I rather think that that is one of the causes of our horses
not looking as well as they might. Watering is almost as important
as feeding, isn’t it?... Horses are my special care, but it’s rather
disheartening having these beastly little country-breds to look
after.”</p>

<p>It may be observed that the Indian country-bred is not accustomed
to a Western winter and heavy snow. Nor were the men of
the Indian Regiments in the Brigade, to whom such weather was as
trying as the extreme heat of India is to English troops.</p>

<p>“I had one horse get his leg broken by a kick from his
neighbour two nights ago. It was smashed clean in two about four
inches above the knee. Must have been some kick, as the bone is
pretty thick at that part. I had him shot where he stood, hitched
on one of the draft horses, and pulled him about 200 feet into a
field over the way, and the defaulters buried him in the afternoon.
A six-foot grave for a horse takes a bit of digging, and fairly made
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
’em sweat. It nearly killed an old fat reservist, who was doing
defaulter for getting drunk on the way up from the Base. However,
if he has a few more to bury, he will be an easier man to
mount.”</p>

<p><i>February 27.</i>&mdash;“To-day we had the coldest day we have had in
France. We paraded at 9 <small>A.M.</small> and did a Brigade scheme. I hated
every minute of it, and so did our wretched horses. We were out
from 9 till 1.45, and most of the time in a snowstorm on the side
of a hill....</p>

<p>“My first servant, Farmer, is a tiger for work. I discovered
the other day that he had been working at a big butcher’s in
Jermyn Street before he joined the Army. As I also found some
young pigs in one of the farms, I took him down to pick out a nice
sucking-pig. He chose one, and I bought it for eight francs, and
we are all going to eat it to-night: Farmer was great at cleaning,
and scalding, and killing it. It was a most comic affair, as there
were about thirteen little pigs, the lady of the farm, Farmer, and
self in a covered sty about 12′ &times; 8′ &times; 6′ high. We were all talking
at once, a child was howling, the pigs were screaming, and we were
all trying to catch a different piglet. At length, however, we succeeded
in collaring the right one, and I’ve never heard any animal
make such a colossal noise as this little beast did when he was
carried off. I nearly died with laughing, as just as we were coming
off the road we met the General riding down. He was frightfully
tickled....”</p>

<p>It appears from Major Cox’s diary that “during the month of
February a semi-station routine of Brigade route-marches, Brigade
field-days, lectures on various subjects, and squadron schemes,
was carried out.</p>

<p>“Quite a lot of snow fell during the month, and cold frosty
weather was the rule.”</p>

<p>March opened with a very sad accident to the battery of Horse
Artillery, V Battery, which formed part of the Brigade.</p>

<p>According to Major Cox’s diary, “A trench-mortar bomb
exploded during instruction, mortally wounding Major Goldie
commanding the battery, two subalterns, and twelve men. Forty-one
N.C.O.’s and men were wounded. As bad luck would have it,
the whole of the battery was assembled round the trench-mortar
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
when the explosion took place.” All officers of the Thirteenth
who could attend the funeral did so, and it was distressing to think
of so many brave men killed and wounded, not by the enemy in fight,
but by an accident of the kind.</p>

<p>This happened in Serny, a village adjoining Enquin.</p>

<p><i>Lieutenant Watson Smyth&mdash;March 7.</i>&mdash;“To-day we had to find
thirteen men a troop to go and dig trenches: they left at
6 <small>A.M.</small>, and aren’t expected back till 8.30 <small>P.M.</small> This left us,
allowing for servants, sick, &amp;c., about six men a troop for duty.
We spent our time tidying up and straightening out the billets,
and have been at it all day.”</p>

<p><i>Lieutenant Chrystall&mdash;March 16.</i>&mdash;“We have been on the
move and bivouacking every night in a wood, so have had no
time to write. We were in the advance to Neuve Chapelle, but
were not used.... We always travel by night owing to hostile
aircraft being about, and the consequence is sleep is impossible.”</p>

<p><i>Captain W. H. Eve&mdash;March 16.</i>&mdash;“I got your letter in hospital
at St Omer.... I was in a terrible funk they would send
me off home, as I knew what that would mean&mdash;two or three
weeks perhaps, and then to Aldershot to wait my turn to come out.
So I got at the doctors at once, and they said I should be kept
there and go straight back to duty as soon as possible. I was
very relieved....</p>

<p>“Then rumours began to come through of this forward movement
of ours between Armenti&egrave;res and La Bass&eacute;e, and the hospital
had to get ready for one thousand extra cases, though holding five
hundred usually. So we knew something was on, and could also
hear the big guns at times. At last on Thursday the 11th they
told me I could leave hospital next day. Of course this is much
too soon really, and would not be done in peace time. But now
it is different.</p>

<p>“I went off to get my movement orders and asked ‘Any news?’
They said, ‘Haig has sent for his Cavalry.’ We are Haig’s
Cavalry&mdash;1st Army&mdash;and you can imagine the state I was in. Next
day I left by train&mdash;8.24&mdash;having slipped out of hospital without
even having my things disinfected.... All the Indian Cavalry
Corps was crowded up there [Berguette?], mostly in billets, but our
Brigade in bivouac in a wood&mdash;all in reserve. We had done
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
nothing so far, and I was relieved. I was fearfully anxious lest I
should be too late.... Well, now you will have seen by the
papers we have done pretty well, but I fancy somehow we haven’t
done all we thought we might. I don’t understand it, and we
don’t know the truth; but they said if we had got as far as we
hoped, the British Cavalry Corps, which had been brought up too,
was to have gone round the north of Lille, and we the Indian
Cavalry Corps round the south, and had a cut at the Germans
behind. But, anyhow, apparently the thing didn’t quite come off,
for on Sunday the 14th we got orders to march back here to billets.
We were very sick indeed; it looked as though we had missed our
chance by so little. But, of course, we really know nothing. We
marched back Sunday night and are now about a couple of miles
from the station where we detrained when we came back from
Orleans, about twenty miles still behind the line.... How long
we shall be here I haven’t the least idea. We have to be ready
to move at two hours’ notice, but that may not mean anything. It
is a dull and trying business this, but we must be patient. We
have quite nice billets here.”</p>

<p>Another account of the move is given by Lieutenant Watson
Smyth: “At 12.30 <small>A.M.</small> on the morning of the 11th we were woke
up and told that the squadron was parading at 3 <small>A.M.</small> We were,
of course, sleeping in our clothes, as everything was packed, and
we had had orders to be ready to move at one hour’s notice. On
being woke up I went to sleep again till 2.15, when I got up, put
my coat and boots on, and went out to hurry up my troop.... We
started to trot about 4.30 <small>A.M.</small> and trotted steadily until 8.30, except
for two very short halts of about three minutes each, when we had
just time to look round our horses. On coming to we turned out
of the town, and the head of the squadron turned out of the road
into a large sand-pit: this was found to be just large enough
for a squadron, so the rest of the regiment was bivouacked in the
wood. (I forgot to say that the sand-pit was in a wood.) We had
easily the best place, as it was quite out of the wind and, better
still, entirely free from mud.... The horses were perfectly happy,
and so were the men. The latter dug holes running into the side
of the pit, put a hurdle over the entrance, and were quite warm
inside. We had very nice weather, sunny and so warm, and had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
nothing to do except listen to the rumble of the guns at Neuve
Chapelle.... We stayed in our sand-pit for three days, and then
one day got orders to move at 2 <small>P.M.</small>; about 1 <small>P.M.</small>, however, these
orders were cancelled, so we thought we might get another night
in peace. This was rather too much to expect, and we were not
very surprised when we were told to parade at 7.45 <small>P.M.</small> We did
so, and had a perfectly ghastly march back to where we are now.
We walked for hours on our horses, and then dismounted, and led
the brutes for three and a half miles. It’s no fun walking on
one’s flat feet when in marching order&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, belt, revolver, spare
ammunition, compass, haversack, field-glasses, knife, and water-bottle.
We then lost ourselves for a bit, and every one lost their
tempers, and cursed everybody junior to themselves, and their
horses, and the roads, and the staff. Eventually we hit our village
about 2 <small>A.M.</small>...</p>

<p>“We got orders to-day, and are off into the blue to-morrow.</p>

<p>“Our night march the other day was extraordinarily impressive,
as we could see the flashes of the guns, and the searchlights
swinging round, and the star-shell, and Very lights lighting up
the whole horizon. The noise of the horses’ hoofs on the pav&eacute;
was not enough to drown the thunder of the guns, and at one time
we distinctly heard the crackle of rifle and machine-gun fire.”</p>

<p><i>March 18.</i>&mdash;“We paraded at 8 this morning and started to
march to &mdash;&mdash;, where we are going to be billeted. About 10
we halted and dismounted.... I tied up the horses, off-saddled,
and let the men fall out to visit the town. At 12.30 I watered and
fed the horses, and succeeded in stealing a bale of hay (100 lbs.) off
a lorry that foolishly halted about ten yards from the horses. That
pleased me and the horses a lot. I am now sitting on a tree-trunk
near the horses writing this.”</p>

<p><i>March 27.</i>&mdash;“I found a dead motor-cyclist to-day: he had
tried to take a corner far too fast in our billets, and had hit a tree
and knocked his head in. I am now hoping to be able to ‘make’
the bike, as except for its front forks and wheel it is in excellent
condition and would be very useful.”</p>

<p>During this month there was much trench-digging, and Major
Cox says, “Brigade field-days and regimental schemes were carried
on similar to the routine in an Indian station.” It was doubtless
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
necessary, but as instruction in Infantry work was going on at the
same time the men were extremely hard worked.</p>

<p>The month closed with a visit from the Honorary Colonel, General
Sir R. S. Baden-Powell, who happened to be in France on a short
tour. An inspection of the Regiment was held, and a short address
was made by Sir Robert, who also presented to the Regiment a
large number of cigarette-cases.</p>

<p><i>Captain W. H. Eve&mdash;April 2.</i>&mdash;“The Indian Cavalry Corps has
been nicknamed ‘The Iron Rations,’ because they are only to be
used in the last extremity. I believe this is all over the place, and
am afraid it may be a little true, though let’s hope not. Anyhow,
it’s very funny and very clever of whoever thought of it. You see
the iron rations (tinned meat and biscuit) carried by each man is
only supposed to be used in the last extremity.”</p>

<p><i>April 19.</i>&mdash;“We are very busy all training more or less as
in peace, and occasionally digging trenches; but one can find out
no news or anything of what’s likely to happen, and can only be
patient. We are all very fit and flourishing and doing ourselves
grand.”</p>

<p><i>Lieutenant Watson Smyth&mdash;April 23.</i>&mdash;“Wild excitement has
possessed us for the last four hours, but it is now dying down, and
in fact is nearly dead. It all started by our getting some wild
story of Ypres, and asphyxiating gas, and the French, and standing-to.
We were just starting out on a Brigade scheme, but this was
abandoned, and we came back to billets and commenced furiously
to pack. We are now feverishly unpacking. It really is extraordinary
the rumours that get about out here; it is only very seldom
that one meets any one who really knows anything worth knowing,
and will tell what it is.</p>

<p>“It is a very good thing for every one to have these occasional
bursts of energy, as one learns a lot about packing, and how things
are lost, &amp;c. To-day, of course, I got caught short of forage.
Some one had stolen one of my sacks of oats.... I had to buy
a sack of oats and feed on oat straw instead of hay. That is
the advantage of a country-bred, he will eat anything, and his
example makes the walers and English join in. I wish we could
get a move on: these are excellent billets, but I want to see a
German before peace is declared!”

<p class="caption">IN THE SANDPIT. MARCH 1915</p></div>

<p><i>Captain W. H. Eve&mdash;April 30.</i>&mdash;“The weather is simply lovely
now, has been these last few days, and to-day has been as hot
as summer. It is very lucky, for we are (all the men and horses)
in the open. We ourselves have got into a barn, where we make
ourselves very comfortable with lots of straw. I have celebrated
my birthday by having a bath. I always carry the indiarubber one
in my saddle-bags, and wouldn’t be without it for anything. Well,
I can’t tell you where we are exactly, but we have moved twice
since I last wrote, owing to this scrap which is still going on near
Ypres.... We are sitting tight again now, listening and waiting.
The only thing we see is our own captive balloons, and occasionally
a Taube (German aeroplane) coming over and being shelled
by our guns. You know, of course, the scrap that is going on now,
but the papers make it out a much more important thing than it
really is. It is a very weak point round Ypres, because (first) it is
a salient, and (secondly) our junction with the French is near
here.... But all goes well, so much so that I fancy we shall
move back in a day or two&mdash;where, I don’t know in the least.
I expect that now we shall be continually up and down the line
on this game&mdash;mobile reserve until our time really comes.</p>

<p>“In this fight our casualties have been very heavy&mdash;ours, I
believe, about 18,000, but we have our line all right.... It’s
hard this waiting, but we must be patient. There is nothing in
the least to worry about, nor is it the important affair the papers
make out.</p>

<p>“We are all tremendously cheery, jolly, and fit.... The
horses are feeling the benefit of the better weather and are a joy
to me now, looking better every day. Of course I seize every
opportunity of grazing them in somebody else’s fields with the
good spring grass coming up. I have never felt fitter in my life.
There are crowds all round, but the worst of it is one can’t go more
than a few hundred yards from one’s billet, as we always have to
be ready to turn out at once.</p>

<p>“The old lady at our last billet insisted on embracing us when
we left with all kinds of good wishes.”</p>

<p>The billets, of course, varied greatly, some being very good
indeed&mdash;one where the officers of the Regiment or squadron were
actually provided with beds and “linen sheets,”&mdash;others very dirty
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
and bad. Lieutenant Chrystall writes on the 19th of May: “It
is very wet and muddy, and we are at present in a coal-mining
village, and everything as you may imagine filthy. Last night I
slept next my skipper on the road with my head between two
spokes of a cart-wheel, and Eve’s between the next. Cobbles are
not very springy or soft!”</p>

<p><i>Captain W. H. Eve&mdash;May 27.</i>&mdash;“You say you are watching
for news of the Cavalry. Well, you have it now in the Casualties
List. That is the British Cavalry. It is, I think, wicked, for they
are men we can’t replace, but the fact is they can’t trust any but
the very best up there at Ypres, and that’s why they sent for the
Cavalry. They get their chance and are used, but we, poor devils!
... never get a chance.... Our turn will come some day.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> Up
there we are holding on and shall do so, but it costs good men.
We sit back here well within sound of the guns, and go on with
more or less peace-training and try to be patient. Whenever there
is a big show on, off we go up behind the line, and every time we
think our time has really come; but every time we come back again
in a few days&mdash;a sort of mobile reserve, that’s all. We are known
out here as the ‘Iron Ration,’ only to be used in the last emergency!
We went up like this during Neuve Chapelle into Belgium
during the fighting round Ypres, and the other day near La Bass&eacute;e.
We are back here again, now very comfortable in a pretty straggling
village.... We are all very fit and flourishing, but rather fed up
with our own share of the proceedings.”</p>

<p>Sometimes the Regiment, or part of it, got a change of work.</p>

<p><i>Lieutenant Watson Smyth&mdash;May 28.</i>&mdash;“The day before yesterday
the bathing season started and we had (the squadron and officers)
gone into the baths at Aire.... We were all just nicely in the
water, which wasn’t very cold, when a heated bicycle orderly
dashed up and said, ‘“B” Squadron to return to billets at once.’
We couldn’t think what it was for.... Yesterday (after a
twenty-mile night march) I went for my orders and discovered
that I am ‘Corps Cavalry,’ and that my duties are to send patrols
out in the Corps area to look out for spies, collect stragglers, control
the traffic at various points, and, in general, be a sort of mounted
police. It is, I believe, an excellent job, and quite good fun.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
Of course the roads are being shelled now and then, but the
people I relieved had only one casualty, and he was gas-poisoned
by a shell. In case of a push I have to find posts at cross-roads,
&amp;c., to direct ammunition and supplies to the various places that
they want to go to. It is very nice being on one’s own, as I am
now. The Squadron Headquarters are about six miles off, so I
shan’t be worried by any one.”</p>

<p><i>Captain W. H. Eve&mdash;May 29.</i>&mdash;“The British Cavalry are out
[of the trenches] now, came out last night, and I think, though
am not quite certain, that the 1st Division of this Corps has gone
in. If this is so, we may perhaps get our turn next. No one would
choose trench fighting, but there’s nothing else just at the present.</p>

<p>“Here we are just peace soldiering. ‘A’ squadron have their
sports on this afternoon and we have ours next week. ‘B’ squadron
has gone off to do Divisional Cavalry&mdash;chiefly orderly&mdash;duties to
various Infantry Divisions. I envy them, as it is a change, and they
are nearer the centre of things.”</p>

<p><i>Lieutenant Chrystall&mdash;June 15.</i>&mdash;“On Sunday last (June 13) I
had the honour of acting as Escort to the King of the Belgians
when he reviewed the Indian Cavalry here. It was quite a decent
show for war-time.”</p>

<p><i>Captain W. H. Eve&mdash;June 16.</i>&mdash;“We have had rumours of a
possible move, but otherwise are carrying on as usual. Lovely
weather, and we are playing polo this evening, which is a great
thing&mdash;having got some sticks and balls out. We have got a Horse-Show
(Cavalry Corps) on Thursday 24th, which ought to be very
good.”</p>

<p><i>Lieutenant Watson Smyth&mdash;July 13.</i>&mdash;I may have got the date
wrong, but the day is Sunday. As far as I can see, there is no likelihood
of our doing anything for a bit. The Regiment is digging
trenches about three miles in rear of the line; we go up for four
days and then come back for eight. In that eight we do exercise
every day except one, when there is a Brigade route-march.”</p>

<p><i>Captain W. H. Eve&mdash;July 11.</i>&mdash;“There is very little news
from here, as you will have gathered from the papers. Kitchener
was out here and came and inspected us last Thursday. He told
us (what none of us knew before) that his father was in the
Regiment. We have been fairly busy, and now have about seventy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
per cent of the men away trench-digging for a week. Three of my
officers and most of my men are gone&mdash;went up in motor-buses
yesterday, and with the few men left I have my work cut out to
exercise and look after the horses.”</p>

<p><i>Lieutenant Watson Smyth&mdash;July 13.</i>&mdash;We are now up at &mdash;&mdash;,&mdash;at
least seventy men and two officers per squadron are&mdash;digging the
second-line trenches. We are about 2000 yards from the Huns,
and they can see us nicely, thank you.... They shelled the
second party yesterday and killed two men of ‘D’ Squadron,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> very
bad luck, as they have shelled the trenches lots of times before
and never yet hit anybody. I had fever all yesterday. I don’t
know why I got it, but I’m all right now....</p>

<p>“We go up in two parties; one goes up at 7 <small>A.M.</small> and digs
from 8.30 to 12.30; the other goes up at 11 and digs from 12.30
to 4.30. It is not very interesting work, but it is better to be
up here than back with the Regiment. There is only one man to
about eight horses, and the result is that every one is working all
day getting the horses exercised, fed, and rubbed over.</p>

<p>“We are up here for a week, we came up last Saturday and
go away next Saturday; as usual, we travel in motor-buses. On
a fine day, after a little rain to lay the dust, this is rather a pleasant

<p>“The Colonel (Symons) has just been ordered to the W.O.
I suppose he is wanted for the Staff. If he is taken from the
Regiment, I don’t know who will get command.”</p>

<p>The writer was wounded two days later. “It was rather a
rotten way of getting hit, standing in a great deep trench, thinking
I was quite safe, when suddenly we heard whe&mdash;bang, and I
found my foot had gone numb. I said, ‘Anybody hit?’ and all the
men said ‘No,’ so I told them I was.” Lieutenant Watson Smyth
goes on to describe his various moves until he reached some days
later the British Red Cross Hospital at Rouen. “I had quite a
good night, and woke up just before arriving here at 6 <small>A.M.</small>...
I showed the doctor a label tied to my pyjamas, giving details of
what was wrong. He told the bearer which ward to take me to,
and off I went.... At 9 <small>A.M.</small> I was carted off to the X-ray room,
and my foot and back were each taken from two positions....</p>

<p>“In the operation they got about sixty pieces out of my foot,
and a few work themselves out every dressing-day.”</p>

<p>Not a word of complaint.</p>

<p><i>August 2.</i>&mdash;“The Regiment’s total casualties for the three weeks
it was digging were four killed, two died of wounds, eight wounded.
No other officers were hit, but one was buried one day, and badly
shaken in consequence....</p>

<p><i>August 3</i> and <i>4</i>.&mdash;“I had a visitor to-day, a Miss Holt, who is
working at Lady Mabelle Egerton’s canteen at Rouen. She was
very nice and cheery and did me a lot of good. They had one
hour’s notice a few days ago that 3000 men and 40 officers would
want breakfast at 3 <small>A.M.</small> There were only three of them on duty
that night, but they managed it all right. That shows that the
canteen is useful, and the workers work, I think....</p>

<p>“Dr Augier is exceedingly pleased at the appearance of my
foot, ... but says that I must resign myself to not using it for
three months.”</p>

<p><i>August 5.</i>&mdash;“Another chap in my Regiment has just come into
the hospital. I have never seen him, as he joined the Regiment
after I was hit. He tells me that the Regiment have been shifted
down south and have taken over, or are going to take over, some
French trenches there for a bit. I do not understand it, but he’s
quite sure of his facts. I should have thought that they had
sufficient Infantry out here now to hold the line, but I expect that
they are fairly quiet trenches, and they want to make the Indian
Cavalry Corps work.”</p>

<p><i>August 5</i> and <i>6</i>.&mdash;“The Regiment is now either in, or just going
into the trenches for a fortnight.... It is a pity to have missed
that....</p>

<p>“I have discovered that I am one of the show-cases here. They
show visitors my X-ray photo, and then bring them along and show
them me. I dislike that. All the doctors seem to think it a
marvellous case.”</p>

<p><i>Captain W. H. Eve&mdash;August 22.</i>&mdash;“I understand absolutely what
you say about wanting a trophy. I hope too I’ll get something some
day, but I won’t bring anything I haven’t got myself, and I have
never seen a German yet. Isn’t it too dreadful, but it’s the truth.</p>

<p>“Richardson has got the Regiment, and I can tell you I am glad.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span></p>

<p><i>Lieutenant Chrystall&mdash;September 7.</i>&mdash;“I have been out on several
night patrols, crawling through the grass towards the German
trenches; and it is very jumpy work, as you never know when you
may bump into one of their patrols.”</p>

<p><i>September 20.</i>&mdash;“The powers that be thought that a certain old
house in No Man’s Land ought to be occupied, and certain snipers
caught who used to frequent the place and fire into our lines. Well,
we occupied it one day and night and held it all day, when just
after dark we were attacked in force. I at the time was holding a
conference with the C.O. at his post, and all of a sudden the sentry
on the outpost let off his rifle. This was the herald of a dozen
bombs being hurled into our place, and the opening of a machine-gun
and several rifles. There we were, ten of us, cooped up in an
outhouse 12 &times; 12, firing like billy O through the window and door
at the flashes of the Boche guns about fifteen yards away. This was
kept up for about ten minutes. When we had just given up all for
lost they ceased firing: we did likewise, and as we were in an
awkward and tight corner we got out of it and held a bridge on a
road. The Germans also retired, and as we afterwards found, left four
dead, while we had only two wounded&mdash;a really miraculous escape,
as bullets were crashing through the windows and splintering the
panelling in the door, and bombs hitting the brick-work.”</p>

<p><i>Captain W. H. Eve&mdash;October 9.</i>&mdash;“We are trying to be patient,
knowing very little and hoping for the best. A few days after I
got back from leave we were moved off, at the beginning of our
offensive, the 22nd [September] to be exact, and were kept in constant
readiness for nearly ten days. We were all cramped up in a
tiny dirty little village, with all our poor horses in the open, a bad
place, with a rotten water-supply, and we had wet cold weather
too. Of course we were desperately excited, but we weren’t allowed
to know much. Then on the 1st we moved on here where we are
now, and where we are more comfortable than we have ever been
before, in a large village, ourselves, the Third, and Brigade Headquarters,
and very nicely situated, and good country. I was very
lucky in the area allotted to my squadron, and have got the whole
of my men and horses comfortably snug under cover, and it is
a real pleasure to see my horses.... Of news we know no more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
than you do from the papers, and, as I say, have simply to try and
be patient, and trust the powers that be, and hope for the very
best....</p>

<p>“Meanwhile they seem desperately hard up for officers for some
of the Infantry&mdash;more senior officers, that is&mdash;and have lately been
sending all round the Cavalry for fellows to volunteer to take
command of battalions and companies.... The other day the
Colonel asked me if I would care to take promotion to Lieut.-Colonel
to command a battalion of infantry, and they have been asking
others also. I refused, but for a man who is ambitious irrespective
of what brand of the service he gets his promotion in, you can see
it is a tremendous chance.... But I doubt if they will get many
men to volunteer for it.... It is extraordinary though, and to me
seems such a very short-sighted policy, for when our time comes
where will they find <i>our</i> officers?”</p>

<p>That was the problem which many Cavalry officers had to face,
and it is not surprising that most of them, loving their own branch
of the service, and still believing, or at least hoping, that the Cavalry
would yet get their chance, should have shrunk from sacrificing their
Cavalry training, even for such promotion. It was a clear proof of
the great straits to which the losses of the war had brought the
Infantry, on whom the brunt had fallen. The letter goes on:&mdash;</p>

<p>“News from Russia appears to me all good, and it does look as
though the tide were turning at last, and the Germans had shot their
bolt, and were up against it.... It’s such a huge thing this war,
and there is such a tremendous lot one wants to know, and so very
little one does know. But I feel as confident as ever, as I think we
all do out here.”</p>

<p>They all did throughout, happily for England.</p>

<p><i>October 10.</i>&mdash;“Nearly every house of a little better class one
goes into here has a stuffed fox in it. I can’t understand why, and
they are such an eyesore to me.”</p>

<p><i>October 12.</i>&mdash;“One of the Poona Horse told me he had had a
great ride after a really good pig this morning, only couldn’t get
him as he had only his sword. I had heard there are some in
these woods, but hadn’t seen any myself so far.”</p>

<p><i>October 13.</i>&mdash;“Here we are in our new quarters at Villers....
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
Coming up here from the river valley we passed the most lovely
coverts&mdash;all the trees turning fast, and with the sun on them simply
looking perfect.”</p>

<p><i>October 14.</i>&mdash;“How I long for us to get a real move on. The
thought of another winter sitting doing nothing like last is
maddening. It can’t be. I feel we must push and push and push.
And here are we drivelling about doing these silly field-days and
‘pretending’ always.”</p>

<p><i>October 15.</i>&mdash;“A confidential memo. came round yesterday asking
for recommendations among N.C.O.’s for the Croix de Guerre and
the M&eacute;daille Militaire. The first is for gallantry, and the other more
like our long-service and good-conduct. It is rather funny for us
who have done practically nothing.”</p>

<p><i>October 17.</i>&mdash;“Then there was a lecture from the Colonel
[Richardson] about drinking in the Regiment, and very well indeed
he spoke too.”</p>

<p><i>October 25.</i>&mdash;“Exercise. Balaclava sing-song for the men.”</p>

<p><i>November 16.</i>&mdash;“This morning there were about four inches of
snow on the ground, and it was still falling hard up to about
11 o’clock. During the morning we sent a challenge to ‘A’
Squadron, saying diplomatic relations were broken off ... and a
state of war would exist from 2 <small>P.M.</small> So at 2 we marched the
squadron down, and I divided them into two parties, one doing
a frontal attack, which drew ‘A’ from their village. When they
were hard at it with snow-balls I brought the remainder, followed
by the M.G., in on their flank, and we had a royal battle, and it
was great fun. The men loved it.”</p>

<p>But it was far from being all snow-balling and play.</p>

<p><i>November 25.</i>&mdash;“You can see what it is trying to make us do
two jobs at the same time, Cavalry and Infantry. The men are
simply worked off their legs and haven’t a minute all day....
We do all our Cavalry parades, all these Infantry ones, route-marches,
afternoon parades, fatigues, evening classes, &amp;c., &amp;c., and
they complain if the men don’t turn out smartly on parade. In
spite of all this we are to organise games, and let the men train
for cross-country runs and so on. Whenever can they possibly
have the time? And ... I must help the country people in their
farming in my spare time.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span></p>

<p><i>December 19.</i>&mdash;“We marched to our new area on Friday last
and got a very bad village to start with, Marival; then yesterday
we moved to a neighbouring one, where we now are, and got
ourselves very comfortable indeed.... We have managed to hire a
large room in a farmhouse here, which we are going to fit up as
a reading and recreation room for the men.... This will make
a good deal of difference to them. They have a very dull and
wretched time, little else but work and dirt. We shall be able to
give them a good spread at Christmas, have ordered puddings,
bought a whole pig, and are getting fruit and vegetables, at sales,
this week. They will have a good feed anyhow. Your cigarettes
will be really welcome and appreciated, there is nothing they want
or appreciate so much....</p>

<p>“What the future may hold we don’t know; but though there is
little news from here, things are very satisfactory all along our
front, and we are very much on top of our friends the Germans.
I have it first hand from Oakes and Annett of my squadron, who
are just back from a month spent in the trenches with different
Infantry regiments....</p>

<p>“Haig’s appointment out here will, I think, make little or no
difference. He is one of French’s men, and both are first-class.”</p>

<p><i>December 27.</i>&mdash;“It has blown continuously for days with a
great deal of rain.... I think we made the men pretty cheery
and comfortable here. They had a great feed, and very much
appreciated all the things that were sent to them. I issued all
their presents on Christmas Eve, a parcel for each from the Regimental
Comfort’s Committee, also from two old comrades, smokes
from some newspapers, matches, match-cases and cards from &mdash;&mdash;,
mittens from &mdash;&mdash;, and cigarettes from &mdash;&mdash;, so they didn’t do so
badly altogether. And they have more stuff to be given out later,
two more goes of puddings sent by various newspapers, &amp;c.,
sweets, and so on. I am spreading them out, leaving a week.</p>

<p>“We ran off a Divisional Marathon race, six miles, here on
Christmas morning, and the Regiment was second. We went
down to eat our dinner with ‘A’ Squadron, Tom Marchant’s
crowd, in the evening, and had a cheery time. ‘A’ Squadron and
ourselves share the same village, and they have got the chateau as
a mess. It is a large, fine old place, but not properly kept up,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
like most of them about here. The owner is in the Army, and only
the old mother, the Dowager Marquise, is living there now. She
came and dined with us....</p>

<p>“We are all very well and flourishing, and are managing to get
a lot of football, &amp;c., arranged for the men now&mdash;so their life won’t
be so bad. This is rotten weather for the trenches. Wet is the
worst for them, nearly always up to their knees, and often deeper
in places. Cold weather they don’t feel nearly so much, owing to
the depth of the trenches.”</p>

<p>So ended for the Thirteenth their first year of war service on the
Western Front. It had been in some ways a year of disappointment.
Though they had had some turns in the trenches, involving a few
casualties, the Regiment had seen no active work as Cavalry.
But if hope deferred had brought them some heart-sickness, there
was hope still, and they entered upon another year under fairly
cheerful conditions.</p>

<span class="large">1916.</span></h2>

<p>The year 1916 opened, as the last had closed, without any exciting
event for the Indian Cavalry Corps. There was heavy fighting for
the Infantry and guns, and the more hopeful spirits in the Thirteenth
Hussars still believed, or tried to believe, that their chance would come
sooner or later, but there seemed to be no immediate prospect of it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the old routine went on.</p>

<p><i>Captain W. H. Eve&mdash;February 6, 1916.</i>&mdash;“We are still busy,
though rather dull, at our ordinary training, ... but the men get
a lot of games, &amp;c., too&mdash;football, running, and so on. We have
been having pretty good weather, much drier, and nothing to
complain of. It has been a wonderfully fine winter so far, but it
isn’t over yet. Things are very forward&mdash;too forward, I am afraid.</p>

<p>“All the land is under crops, which interferes terribly with our
field-work.</p>

<p>“Oakes (2nd in command, ‘D’ Squadron) is at present in
hospital with a kick on the shin (football), but otherwise we are all
very well and flourishing.”</p>

<p><i>March 19.</i>&mdash;“There is little or no news from here except that
our proposed move is, I think, postponed for a time. I am sending
another digging party away to-day and one comes back. I expect
we shall always have a certain number of men away now, digging
in second line. We are all very fit and flourishing.”</p>

<p>It was a necessary measure of precaution to have lines of trench
behind the fighting line. All hoped to go forward, but in case of
overwhelming German attacks, strong intrenched positions on which
troops could fall back were an obvious need. The letter goes on:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span></p>

<p>“I attended a trench-warfare class for a week about a fortnight
ago, which was a change, but taught me very little.</p>

<p>“The weather is all in our favour for work, but it means that in
this closely cultivated country it is almost impossible to find ground to
work over, now that they are so busy with the spring work on the land.”</p>

<p>“During this time,” writes Lance-Corporal Bowie, “we had many
inspections, the chief one being by General Remington, commanding
the Indian Cavalry Corps in the new year.... The Regiment not
being required in the actual firing line at this time, many men were
sent on various courses of instruction, such as M.M.P.’s, signalling,
pigeon-flying, intelligence, &amp;c. On January 31st a party left by
motor-buses for the village of &mdash;&mdash;, to construct trenches, &amp;c.,
being relieved on March 14th by another party. On March 26th
we proceeded to Feuqui&egrave;res-en-Vimes. From here the Regiment
left for St Riquier on April the 4th to commence Divisional training,
after which we returned to Feuqui&egrave;res on the 18th, meanwhile
continuing to relieve our parties in trench-digging.... Later we
again proceeded to St Riquier to take part in the Corps training,
after which we again returned to Feuqui&egrave;res. The remainder of our
stay here was occupied by sports, horse-shows, &amp;c., the chief event
being an International Horse Show held at Oisemont in May. This
event was marked by the attendance of many noted French Generals
and the 3rd French Army Corps from Verdun. Immediately afterwards
we again proceeded to St Riquier to take part in the Grand Manœuvres.”</p>

<p>It all reads more like peace-time than the middle of the greatest
of wars. But such was the condition of things for the Cavalry of the
Allied and enemy armies on the Western Front. The extension of the
front from the sea to Switzerland, and the development of the great
line of trenches which covered it, had put an end to all open warfare.
The contending hosts were locked in a desperate struggle, which
swayed backwards and forwards over a few miles of devastated and
blood-soaked ground, giving no opening for the sweeping movements
of horsemen. Month by month it became more and more evident
that there was no immediate likelihood of this state of things being
changed. Neither side seemed strong enough to tear a gap in the
opposing line and let through a flood of horsemen into its rear. Till
that could be done there could be no chance for the Cavalry as
Cavalry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span></p>

<p>Meanwhile the war was developing all over the world, especially
in Africa and Asia, and in some quarters the conditions were very
different from those obtaining in the densely-peopled districts of the
main front, where the colossal armies stood face to face. On two
other fronts especially, where Great Britain was opposed to the
Turks, horsemen had room to move and were badly needed. In
Egypt and Palestine, and in Mesopotamia and Persia, the armies
engaged were not in such numbers as to cover the whole ground and
reduce the war to the likeness of a gigantic siege. Even there, on
the broad plains of Asia, trenches and aeroplanes were to some extent
in use, and did much to limit the operations of Cavalry; but they
were not all-important. There was still room for open warfare and
turning movements and surprise. And for service in those countries,
with their comparatively dry climates and hard soil and great heat,
the Indian soldier was specially fitted&mdash;much better fitted, to tell the
truth, than for the cold and mud of Europe. It was therefore decided
in the early part of 1916, when trained white troops were beginning
to pour out of England in great numbers, that the work of the
Indian Army on the European front was done, and that for the future,
with its numerous and excellent Cavalry, it could be more usefully
employed in other theatres of war.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p>It has always been the custom to send on service with Indian
troops a certain proportion of white men, and much as the white
troops were needed in Europe, it was felt that the custom must be
maintained in this case. The Indian Regiments now sent to fight
in Africa and Asia were therefore mixed as usual with British
Regiments. The officers of the Indian Regiments had every
confidence in the troops they led; but it would have been a
tremendous test to send Indian soldiers unsupported by British
troops to face the renowned fighting men of Turkey, organised and
directed by Germans, and equipped with all the latest appliances
of modern war. The strain would have been increased by the fact
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
that the number of British officers serving with an Indian Regiment
is always small&mdash;probably not half the number serving with
a British Regiment.</p>

<p>As to the Thirteenth, they were warned in the middle of June
to prepare for service in the East, and there were persistent rumours
that the destination of the Brigade would be Mesopotamia, where
a serious reverse had lately been inflicted upon British arms by the
capture of General Townshend and ten thousand men at Kut.</p>

<p>These rumours were well founded, for the nation rightly felt
that such a humiliation must be wiped out, and the Meerut Brigade,
including the Thirteenth Hussars, was among the troops selected
to retrieve the position.</p>

<p>“It was on the 17th day of June,” writes Private C. T. Massey,
“that my Regiment, the Thirteenth Hussars, who were at that time
digging trenches for cables behind the lines in France, received orders
to get ready to return to their billets at Chessy, a little village a
few miles distant from the town of Abbeville. We heard that the
Regiment was under orders for leaving the country, and rumours were
flying all over the place: some said Salonika, others said India, whilst
others said Basra, a modern town of 10,000 inhabitants on the
right bank of the river Tigris in Mesopotamia, and the last one
proved to be correct.... On arriving in billets we found great
excitement prevailed, and every one said we were leaving for Mesopotamia.
Every one was in the best of spirits and glad to be leaving
France, where Cavalry were inactive.”</p>

<p>That was the right spirit in which to take the move; and
though no doubt there had been much disappointment among
officers and men with the fact that in France “Cavalry were inactive,”
it would not be easy to find among all their letters and diaries
bearing on this time a word of murmuring or regret at the prospect
of turning their backs on England again, and entering upon another
term of distant Eastern service. The universal feeling was one of
satisfaction at being sent to some other theatre of war where
Cavalry would come into its own.</p>

<p>Private Massey’s diary goes on to describe the voyage out.</p>

<p>“On the 19th we were officially informed that the Regiment was
leaving France for Mesopotamia, and the same day we left for the
railhead at Pont R&eacute;my, a fairly large station.... Whilst waiting,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
a train-load of Belgian soldiers passed through and we gave them
a rousing cheer.... All was soon ready, and at 6 the train moved
off. We were travelling all day the 20th and the 21st, and on the
morning of the 22nd we arrived at Marseilles, and after detraining
with our horses, limber, and equipment, proceeded towards La
Valentine Camp. We remained in the camp until the 27th, which
we left at 7.30 that day, and proceeded to the docks at Marseilles.”</p>

<p>It appears from the Regimental Diary that the Regiment embarked
30 officers and 582 other ranks. Private Massey goes on:&mdash;</p>

<p>“We handed over our horses to a native regiment. I gave my
old horse (No. 62) a few pats on the neck, as he had been a good
old horse, and he had carried me hundreds of miles, and I was
sorry to lose him. We afterwards went on board the <i>Kalyan</i>, and
I was put on guard over the steps leading to the bridge; others were
put on submarine guard, and every precaution was taken to prevent
the ship being torpedoed.... On the 31st we were issued out
with Indian khaki, as it was getting very hot the farther we went
south. The next few days the sea became very rough, and on
2nd July I was sick after tea.</p>

<p>“On the 3rd we arrived at Port Said after a very uneventful
voyage. On the voyage across we received the news by wireless
every day, so we knew that the great offensive had begun. We
watched the coaling of the boat, during the afternoon of the 3rd,
and it struck me as a mild form of slavery, to see the natives coaling
the ship: they work like devils, and all for a few annas a day.
Native boys swim round the ship, diving for pennies which we
threw them from the deck.</p>

<p>“When we woke at r&eacute;veill&eacute; on the following morning the boat
was already on the move down the Canal.... Towards night
we sailed past Port Suez, but we could not see much of it; but it
looked magnificent with the streets lighted up, and it seemed to
stretch a long way along the coast.</p>

<p>“After sailing down the Red Sea for several days we entered
the Indian Ocean. We saw large shoals of flying-fish in the Red
Sea, also other big fish.</p>

<p>“We had an uneventful voyage across the Indian Ocean, and
arrived outside Bombay at about 9 <small>A.M.</small> on the 15th of July. On
the 16th we went into dock soon after r&eacute;veill&eacute;, disembarked, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
marched to Colaba Camp, about four miles from the docks. I
went with several others to the swimming-baths, and for the first
time in my life managed to swim a few yards. I was so fond of
the salt water that I was in it again that night, aided by the light
of the moon.”</p>

<p>Lance-Corporal Bowie, already quoted, strikes the same note
about the horses. “Here” (at Marseilles), he writes in his diary,
“our horses were taken from us, many of us being very sorry to
part with some splendid horses which we had brought with us
from India, and which had carried us so well all the time in France.”
In that respect the officers were more fortunate than the men.
Though it was not thought desirable to send the troop-horses back
again to the East, the officers were allowed to take their chargers&mdash;about
100 in all,&mdash;a great boon.</p>

<p><i>June 26, 1916.</i>&mdash;“All has gone well,” writes the officer commanding
“D” Squadron, “and I am taking all my three children with
me.” And later from Marseilles he mentions “the glad news that
we are taking our own children with us.... We have handed
over a certain number of the best of the walers and country-breds
to the 30th, including, I am sorry to say, ‘Jean,’ and the remainder
all go to the depot to-morrow when we depart.... All the
Regiment will be together, and the ‘children’ with us too. It could
hardly be better, all things considered.”</p>

<p>From Port Said again: “All is well. It’s the usual dull routine,
but better than I remember it before in these parts. The great
mercy for me is having the children with us. They give me an
interest and are most comfortable&mdash;tons of room, two or three
stalls for each, and very flourishing so far. ‘Caprice’ was off her
feed and with a temperature yesterday afternoon, but only for a
little while, and is as fit as anything to-day.”</p>

<p>It is satisfactory to know that for the most part they arrived
safely in India, and, though none the better for their voyage, were
able to do good service afterwards.</p>

<p>In spite of all it was not an exhilarating voyage. Very little
was known to the Regiment about the prospect before them, and
not much about what was going on in France.</p>

<p><i>Captain Eve&mdash;Suez.</i>&mdash;“As soon as we arrived yesterday we heard
the push had started and that we had got through on a front of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
twenty-five miles, but we didn’t get the telegrams with any details
till the afternoon: let us only pray we may do as well as we hope.”</p>

<p>Alas! it was a vain prayer. There were to be many “pushes”
before the final one two years later.</p>

<p><i>July 14.</i>&mdash;“We get to the end of our march to-morrow. I
needn’t tell you how glad we shall be. It has seemed desperately
long&mdash;very different to when going the other way. We are all very
fit and flourishing.”</p>

<p>A later letter describes the voyage in more detail, and may be
worth quoting as an example of war-time voyages. “We went by
ourselves, but had various kinds of escorts through the Mediterranean:
sometimes a destroyer, sometimes a sham tramp steamer, really of
course armed with guns, and sometimes with no visible escort at
all; and we went the most peculiar way, all round the west and
south sides of Corsica and Sardinia, south of Malta, north of Crete,
then south and zigzagged about a lot before making Port Said.
I believe a ship was sunk off the north-east corner of Crete not long
before us. I think our sham tramp steamers are the most lovely
things. Of course we had all lights out, ports closed, no smoking
after dark, and great discomfort, and heaps of guards and submarine
look-outs, and it was very hot but mostly very calm. However, all
this ended at Port Said, where also they took off our gun and
gunners.... We left at 10 <small>P.M.</small> and went through the Canal very
slowly, stopping a long time in the lakes. The camps and trenches
had increased enormously, the most perfect trenches now, and huge
camps. It is quite a sight, very strong, and there must be a large
force in Egypt now. They looked wonderfully fit, and yelled to us
to know where we were going, but we would not say.”</p>

<p>Arrived at Bombay, the Regiment was informed that it was
definitely for Mesopotamia, and the news was received with the
greatest pleasure, as doubtful rumours had been in circulation.
They had, in fact, been better founded than most rumours, for shortly
before the arrival of the Thirteenth, it had been decided that the
Brigade was not to leave the country again. The Thirteenth were to
return to Meerut, and the Seventh Hussars were to take their place
with the Mesopotamia force. Why this decision was altered does not
appear, but report said that the Seventh were wanted on the North-West
Frontier, where trouble was brewing, and the Thirteenth were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
taken for Mesopotamia after all. Nevertheless, the old Meerut Brigade
was broken up, the 3rd Skinner’s Horse and 30th Cavalry being
retained in India, to their intense disappointment. The 3rd and
the Thirteenth Hussars had lain alongside one another for five years,
and it was with special regret that they said good-bye to each
other. The place of the two native regiments was taken by the
13th and 14th Indian Lancers. The Meerut Brigade now became
the 7th Cavalry Brigade of the Mesopotamia Field Force. It
retained with it V Battery of Horse Artillery, which had suffered
so severely in France.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Regiment had lost the services of some officers
from illness. Second-Lieutenant Guy Pedder writes on the 4th
of July, evidently from the Suez Canal, though after the manner
of the time his letter is dated only “on ship going out”:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Four officers have fallen out now&mdash;Covell in France, Kennedy
at Marseilles, Munster at Port Said, and Wingfield at the next
stop.... I wonder where we will get our first letters, &amp;c.; it will
be rather interesting. We travel very slowly along here, and stop
at each lake as far as I can make out! There are no more submarine
guards to be done, thank goodness. I was on eight hours
each day, four by day and four by night. Saw a paper yesterday
which said we had got the first-line trenches over sixteen mile
frontage&mdash;wonder if the push is going on as well as was expected.”</p>

<p><i>July 14.</i>&mdash;“I expect the first news you will have got of me will
be the cable I sent from Port Said; we haven’t put into harbour
since then, but were able to drop some letters to a small boat just
opposite Suez, but I don’t know whether you will get that letter.
We hope to reach Bombay to-morrow; if so, this letter will just
catch the mail, and I will cable to you to-morrow.</p>

<p>“Of course we got out of the danger zone when we got to
Port Said. It was very hot, but very interesting in the Canal.
Then followed the Gulf, which was calm and dull for four days.
Then we got into the Sea, and the so-called terrible monsoon;
but it wasn’t a bit terrible, although the ship rolled like anything
for four days; lots of fellows were sick, and felt very bad, but I
was as fit as anything all the time, and smoked cigars and
pipes, &amp;c.</p>

<p>“No one knows our final destination up to date, but I fancy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
we will be in India for a couple of months at least, and then go
on. I am looking forward to seeing India awfully, and hope we
stay there for a short time at any rate.... I have enjoyed the
voyage very much, but am just getting bored with it to-day, and
want to see a paper and hear the war news: of course we have
had none for over a week. This is a topping ship, but we have
come along very slowly to save coal. They feed us very well.
We had to run for it once in the Mediterranean, but we did not
know it at the time, only guessed. It has been very much too
rough to play cricket, but to-day it is much calmer. We’ve had
two frightfully heavy rainstorms. Only two horses have died, and
both mine are all right. I sang several times after dinner, and on
the whole I think the time has flown. I am longing to hear about
the Western Front. There is an excellent library on board, and I
must have read twenty books, &amp;c.”</p>

<p><i>Bombay, Royal Bombay Yacht Club&mdash;July 17.</i>&mdash;“This is an extraordinary
place, and awfully pretty by night; Daniell (the Staff
Captain) gave a large dinner-party here last night, and very nice it
was too. I went to the Cathedral yesterday evening after a very
busy day, and this morning I have been rushing round shopping.
You hardly see two people dressed alike here. This is a ripping
Club, and we are all honorary members, Indian Expeditionary Force
(D). To-day’s paper tells us a little about the part played by
what would have been us in the West!”</p>

<p>The hope of staying a short time and seeing India was not to
be fulfilled. The state of affairs in Mesopotamia admitted of no
delay, and it was soon known that the Regiment was to embark
at once for Basra. It was to be carried in two vessels, the <i>Islanda</i>
and <i>Chilka</i>, the former taking “A” and “D” Squadrons, less one
troop of “D,” under Captain Eve, and the latter the Headquarters
and remainder of the Regiment under Colonel Richardson.</p>

<span class="large">MESOPOTAMIA.</span></h2>

<p>The campaign in which the Thirteenth Hussars were now to share
was of great importance to England, and not without importance to
the decision of the world-war. It may be well to say something here
on the subject.</p>

<p>The designs of Germany in bringing about, after many years of
elaborate preparation, the conflict of 1914, were not fully understood
until they were laid bare in Ch&eacute;radame’s book, ‘The German Plot
Unmasked,’ which was published in 1916, with an Introduction by
Lord Cromer. Though England was the greatest of Asiatic powers,
and more concerned in the march of events in the East than any
other nation of Europe, except possibly Russia, she had to learn from
a Frenchman how her Eastern Empire was threatened by Germany&mdash;just
as she had formerly had to learn from an American sailor,
though she was the greatest of maritime nations, the influence of
sea-power upon History.</p>

<p>To put it in a few words, Germany aimed, as Napoleon had aimed
a century earlier, not only at supreme dominion in Europe, but at
supreme dominion throughout the world. To effect this aim she had
brought about the alliance with Austria, which placed at her disposal
the whole resources of the great central European block, about a
hundred and twenty millions of people highly organised for war,
and had also succeeded in establishing her paramount influence over
Turkey, which meant not only another twenty millions of people,
but a vast territory stretching very nearly from the frontiers of
Austria across the Bosphorus and far into Asia. The inclusion in
the alliance of the comparatively small but powerful state of Bulgaria
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
practically completed Germany’s line of communication with Turkey,
and made her in fact dominant from the Baltic to Constantinople,
and on through Asia Minor to Arabia. A great strategic line of
railway had been designed, and in part constructed, which was to
run from Constantinople to Baghdad, and was to be continued to a
terminus on the shores of the Persian Gulf.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_099" src="images/i_099.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">“GERMANY AND HER CONFEDERATES”</p></div>

<p>Italy was a doubtful ally, but was nominally with Germany too,
and might at least be regarded as neutral.</p>

<p>The German scheme was to deal first with the two great
Continental powers which stood in Germany’s way, France and
Russia. If they could be attacked and overthrown, as she believed
they could be, by a swift onslaught upon each of them in turn, the
Continent of Europe would be at her feet. It was calculated that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
England would be neither willing nor able to interfere in their behalf
before their fate was sealed. Then, with France and Russia powerless,
or even possibly enlisted as vassal States, Germany would turn upon
the only power which stood between her and the dominion of the
world&mdash;England. Having a contemptibly small Army, and no allies
in Europe, England would either come to heel without fighting, or
would be attacked in India and overwhelmed, probably with the help
of the Indians themselves. Her fleet would not be able to help her
against vast armies, German and other, marching upon the Indian
frontier from Asiatic Turkey, and the few hundred thousand trained
men she could put into line would be swamped by ten times their
numbers. Afterwards, if America or Japan or China gave any trouble,
it would be easy enough to deal with them. The only powers that
really counted were the three great European powers&mdash;France and
Russia with their trained armies, and England with her trained fleet.</p>

<p>It was an ambitious scheme, but not one that could be regarded
as visionary. It did not take sufficient account of England’s
sea-power; but undoubtedly if France and Russia had both been
struck down, and England had been left standing alone, he would
have been a very fearless Englishman who could have faced the
future without apprehension. Even supposing that no immediate
attack upon England had followed, her prospect of holding her own
indefinitely against a Germany rapidly outgrowing her in population
and wealth would not have been promising. The silent deposition
of the naval power of France by that of Germany in the course of
a few years before the War had been a striking lesson. But as a
matter of fact a great attack upon England was undoubtedly contemplated.
“Der Tag” was to have come, and come soon.</p>

<p>Can any one feel sure that if England had stood by while France
and Russia were overwhelmed she could afterwards have successfully
resisted that attack? The Boer War had shown that at the beginning
of the century a combination of the Continental powers against her
was not improbable. Would it have been less probable fifteen or
twenty years later, when the sea strength of those powers compared
with her own had vastly increased, and when France and Russia had
been incensed against her by her failure to help them in their time
of need? And if all the navies of Europe had joined against her,
could she have drawn for help on India and the Dominions beyond
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
the seas? Would she not have found it hard enough to protect
her own coasts? Happily for her she did not stand aside, and
that issue was never put to the test. Unready for war as she was,
and unwilling, she struck with sure instinct before it was too late.</p>

<p>Even so, though England threw in her lot with Russia and
France, the struggle was not an unequal one, and, as everyone knows,
there were times when it seemed that the Allies might lose the war,
or at all events fail to make more than a drawn fight of it. Their
latent numbers and resources were greater, but the enemy enjoyed
the immense advantage of having chosen his own time, when he was
ready and they were not. He had also the advantage of united
command and of the central position, whilst the Allies were widely
separated. These advantages very nearly outbalanced latent numbers
and resources. Eventually they proved insufficient to do so, but
they nearly succeeded. Nothing prevented Germany winning but the
fact that she had to put out all her armed power at once, and to fight
England then, instead of reserving her Turkish strength for a separate
duel with England later.</p>

<p>How formidable her Turkish strength was, a glance at the map
will show. Not only were the Turks a great military nation, with
warlike traditions and a population capable of raising two millions of
fighting men, but Turkey stood across the Straits between Europe
and Asia, and while guarding them could throw her weight freely
upon the East. India was England’s most sensitive point, the one
where she was exposed to military aggression by land. Strike her
there, the Kaiser thought, as Napoleon had thought before him, and
the clay feet of the great image would crumble under her.</p>

<p>Between Europe and the Indian frontier lies a stretch of
country 2500 miles in breadth, held by three independent powers,
Turkey, Persia, and Afghanistan.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> All these powers are Mahomedan,
and of the three Turkey is, or was in 1914, by far the most powerful.
Not only was she the strongest from a military point of
view, but in the eyes of countless millions of Mahomedans the
Sultan of Turkey was the head of the faith, the true successor of
the Prophet; and he was entirely in German hands. His power
extended over a thousand miles, to the frontier of Persia, which
was not only weak, but at the moment unlikely to use such
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
strength as she had on England’s side. Turks and Persians
certainly did not belong to the same sect of the Mahomedan
faith, and had often been enemies in the past. But the Persians
after all were Mussulmans, and their religious sympathies in any
quarrel between Mahomedans and Christians were sure to be
against the Christians. Persia held a thousand miles more of the
space between Europe and India. Beyond her again to the eastward,
right up to the Indian border, lay the third of the independent
powers&mdash;Afghanistan. The external relations of Afghanistan
were supposed to be under British control, and her ruler
enjoyed a British subsidy. But his people were turbulent and
fanatical, and belonged for the most part to the same religious
division of Islam as the Turks. They were believed to have little
love for the British, who had more than once invaded their country.
Finally, along the Indian border itself, and inside India, there
were perhaps seventy millions of Mahomedans, some belonging
to wild mountain tribes, constantly at war against the British, and
most of the rest inclined to acknowledge the religious supremacy
of the Sultan. These Mahomedans had, as a rule, served the
British Government with fidelity, and formed a considerable part
of the Indian Army. But they too were of the faith. Surely the
Germans had some ground for hoping that if the Turks made a
vigorous push towards India from their own Asiatic territory, their
armies, organised and commanded by German officers, and supported
by a hot religious propaganda, would succeed in doing much evil to
England. They might, perhaps, succeed in sweeping the independent
Mahomedan States with them into a great invasion of India. In
any case they would seriously disturb the country, and probably
stir up a Mahomedan revolt with which England would find it hard
to deal. If backed by a great German army they would be irresistible.</p>

<p>The Kaiser was not far wrong. Even though by joining
France and Russia in 1914 England disarranged the German calculations,
and brought on the Eastern conflict prematurely from
a German point of view, it was shown that there had been good
reason for the Kaiser’s confidence. Turkey under German direction
proved strong enough, even without the help of a German army
in the East, not only to repulse a great Anglo-French attack upon
her in the Dardanelles, but to inflict much loss upon England in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
Western Asia, and with the aid of a strong politico-religious
propaganda, to cause sensible trouble on the Indian border. In
the end she failed, and the blow which was to have brought about
the overthrow of England in India resulted in the complete
collapse of the Turkish Empire: India, instead of being a source
of weakness to England, turned out to be a great addition to her
military power. But before this result was reached there were four
years of hard fighting, and at times the issue seemed to be very
doubtful. Unquestionably, the Anglo-Turkish conflict was a matter
of great moment, and the result of it seriously affected the success
of the whole German scheme.</p>

<p>It is interesting to consider in some farther detail what was
the strategical position of Turkey with regard to war in Asia when
she elected to draw the sword. The original home of the Ottoman
Turks was on the Asiatic side of the Straits, and it was there
that in this century, if not always, the main strength of the
Ottoman Empire has lain. Asia Minor was the great recruiting
ground for the Turkish armies, and the great central base from
which she could strike out eastward. Assuming that her alliances
in Europe, and the possession of the immensely strong position on
the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles, made her practically secure
on the western side, as proved to be the case, the value of the
Asia Minor base for action eastward was very great indeed.
There she could place the bulk of her large army, and from there
she could throw her weight upon the distant possessions of the
Allies, where they were incapable of much mutual help,&mdash;upon the
Russians in the Caucasus on her left&mdash;upon Persia, and possibly
through Persia upon India in the centre&mdash;upon Egypt on her right.
The Allies, hard pressed in Europe, and therefore comparatively
weak on these extremities of the great semicircle, seemed to be at
an almost hopeless disadvantage in meeting the blows she might
strike, outwards as it were from the handle of an open fan towards
the end of the spokes. Her fronts in Asia were three&mdash;Armenia,
Persia, Palestine; and it seemed that from her inner position she
could act with greater effect upon each of these fronts than the
scattered Allies could do, acting from the outside inwards.</p>

<p>On the central of the three fronts the Turks were perhaps in a
specially strong position, for they had an established secondary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
base in Mesopotamia, with its famous capital Baghdad, to which
extended, though with one or two gaps, the great strategical railway
from Constantinople. Beyond Baghdad they held the lines of
the Euphrates and Tigris rivers, and could push eastward into
Persia by the highroad which from time immemorial has seen the
march of conquering armies eastwards and westwards,&mdash;the armies of
the Persians for Marathon and Plat&aelig;a&mdash;the armies of Alexander the
Great on their way to India&mdash;and numberless others before and since.</p>

<p>But what German and Turk alike failed to understand, or at all
events to appreciate at its full value, was the sea-power of England.
Sea-power had in old days given Rome the mastery over Carthage,
and in later times it had enabled England to wear out Napoleon.
It was to be the deciding factor now in the overthrow of the Turkish
Empire, and with the Turkish Empire, of the great German scheme
of world domination.</p>

<p>For recognising at once the great danger to India of letting the
Turks push forward into Persia, and possibly into Afghanistan,
recognising also the value of the Persian oil-fields and other British
interests in that ancient country, Great Britain had determined not
to await Turkish and German aggression on its Indian frontier, but
to meet the threat with a bold offensive on Turkish soil. Directly
it became certain that Turkey had thrown in her lot with the
Central Powers, in the autumn of 1914, an expeditionary force
sailed from India for the Persian Gulf, and seized the mouth of the
Shat-el-Arab, by which the Tigris and Euphrates pour into the
sea. The objects of this expedition were at first limited. The
protection of the oil-wells, of such importance to our Navy, and
the blocking of the German strategical railway through Baghdad,
were all that was immediately contemplated. But the comparatively
easy success of the Indian force, mainly composed of native Indian
soldiery, in defeating the Turkish troops near the coast, encouraged
the British commanders to push on up the rivers into Mesopotamia.
In 1915, a year after the outbreak of war, a force under General
Townshend had taken Kut-el-Amara, three hundred miles from the
sea, and the attack on the Dardanelles being on the point of open
failure, it was decided that as a counterblast to this failure Great
Britain should strike a great blow in the East by marching to
Baghdad and conquering all Turkish Arabia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span></p>

<p>It was an important decision, and full of interest in many ways.
Mesopotamia is the cradle of history, sacred and profane. It is the
legendary site of the Garden of Eden, and from its plains, from Ur
of the Chaldees, the Patriarch Abraham set out with his flocks and
herds for the Holy Land. After his day it was the site of great
empires. Babylon lies in the centre of it, Nineveh not far to the
north, Shushan a few score miles to the east. It has seen Grecian
and Roman armies as well as Asiatic hosts, and the first explosion
of the new Mahomedan faith was across its plains to Ctesiphon,
and Persia, and Syria. Baghdad soon arose as the Mahomedan
capital, and became famous throughout the world. Undoubtedly,
to attack Turkey in Mesopotamia was to cover India and Persia
from attack on her part; and to beat her out of Baghdad was to
strike her a blow which would resound all over the world. She
would perhaps exhaust herself in trying to recover her position
there, as Napoleon exhausted himself trying to recover from a
similar sea-borne blow in Spain. From the time when Townshend was
ordered to advance on Baghdad, the Mesopotamian Front became one
of the important theatres on which the Great War was being played.</p>

<p>As a fighting ground, Mesopotamia had some advantages for
Great Britain, and some great drawbacks. The southern part of it
came down to the sea, and communications with India and England
were therefore open. Everything required for the conduct of war
could be supplied. Moreover, though the climate of Mesopotamia
was hot in summer, it was perhaps, as before remarked, better suited
for the Indian soldiery, who formed the bulk of the British forces,
than what Europeans would consider a more healthy climate, the
temperate climate of Northern France. Its plains too were free
from the geographical obstacles of mountainous countries. Right
up to Baghdad they were flat and bare, very different from the
wild fighting grounds of the Indian frontier, with their rocky peaks
and forest-clad hillsides and rushing torrents.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the summer heat in Mesopotamia was
excessive, even for Indians, and desperately trying to white men,
while in winter the wind and cold were at times severe. Moreover,
the very flatness of the Mesopotamian plains was a difficulty. The
great rivers which wound across them were in the rainy season
swollen by the melting snows of their upper courses, until they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
overflowed their banks, and caused vast inundations and swamps
impassable for troops. The march of military forces in the hot
season, with the thermometer in tents at 120&deg; or more, was too
deadly to face, and movement in the flood season was impossible;
so the real fighting season was almost limited to the time from the
end of the heat till the filling of the rivers&mdash;that is, from about the
middle of October to the middle of March.</p>

<p>At all other times, and indeed at all times, the rivers themselves
were the chief means of communication for troops and supplies;
and boats of any carrying power were few. Even when armed
movement on land was possible, any advance against an enemy in
position was a formidable task, for the flat ground afforded not a
vestige of cover, and troops had often to go forward to the assault
of trenches over ground as smooth and bare as a billiard-table,
perhaps up to their knees in mud, with deep swamps on each side
preventing any attempt at a turning movement. Mud, indeed,
proved to be a more formidable obstacle than mountains and
ravines. Troops could not advance over it with any freedom or
swiftness, and they could not camp in it without misery and loss;
nor could they be fed in large numbers, for it made the transport
of supplies very difficult. Then the whole country, though not
really friendly to the Turks, was inhabited by Arabs who were
anything but friendly to an invader. Whether in the marshy lands
near the rivers or on the dry plains beyond, they were always
hanging on the flanks of an advancing or retreating force, their
desert horsemen as elusive as the “web-footed” men of the
marshes, swift to gather and as swift to vanish in the mirage of
an enchanted land where all seemed fantastic and unreal. With
stubborn Turkish soldiery, organised by Germans, intrenched in
large numbers along the river lines, and supported by larger
numbers of these irregular auxiliaries on every side, the country
was no easy field of action for a British army.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in spite of all difficulties of climate and ground,
the British expeditionary force had by the autumn of 1915
established itself in control of the river mouths, with a considerable
Turkish province in its hands. Then, in an evil hour, came the
decision to advance on Baghdad, and a single British Division was
pushed forward. It was a very daring if not an insane project,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
and it failed. Before the end of the year the unfortunate Division
found itself besieged by superior forces at Kut-el-Amara, and in
the following April, after a siege of five months, a starving British
force of more than 10,000 men, nearly 3000 of them white men,
was marched away by the Turks into bitter captivity.</p>

<p>This was the heaviest blow that had ever been dealt to British
arms and British prestige in Asia. Not only had 10,000 men been
taken prisoners, but the Turks had inflicted upon other British
forces trying to relieve them a series of bloody repulses. Struggling
forward, time after time, with splendid devotion over the muddy
flats, in vain attempts to drive from strong lines of trenches an
enemy superior in numbers, our soldiery, white and black, had lost
over 20,000 men in killed and wounded, and had been forced to
admit that for the time they could do no more. The Turks had
won a striking success, the measure of which to Great Britain was
the loss of an Army Corps.</p>

<p>But, much to its credit, the British nation refused to accept the
defeat in Mesopotamia as a final one. Though staggered by it and
the still greater repulse at the Dardanelles, England resolved that
the Turks should yet be conquered. Smarting from her defeats,
she was not wholly just to the leaders who had done all that men
could do to effect impossibilities. Some honourable reputations
were sacrificed, and wrong done to brave and capable soldiers.
But at least her resolution did not fail. Her legions, rapidly
increasing not only on the soil of the British Islands but throughout
the Empire, and made available by her sea-power for employment
all over the world, were poured upon the Turkish frontiers.
The Turks had dealt her two stunning blows; but brave fighters as
they had shown themselves to be, they were to learn, as Germany
learnt, that it is not prudent for any nation to rouse the English.</p>

<p>In Mesopotamia the military chiefs who had failed in their
attempts to reach Kut before its garrison was starved into surrender,
were relieved of their commands, and the Mesopotamian
force was entrusted to General Maude, who, unlike them, was
now given time to collect a large army, properly organised and
equipped, and was helped in his task by every possible means
both in India and in England. Troops were sent to him in
numbers sufficient to let him meet the Turks on at least equal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
terms, and immense efforts were put forth to give him the
necessary equipment for scientific modern warfare, and the transport
necessary for effective action. Roads and railways were
established, and above all, a great fleet of river steamers was
gathered from various parts of the world, in order that he might
be able to use to the full the natural highways of the country.
During the whole summer of 1916 these preparations were steadily
pushed on, with a view to another advance when the hot weather
would be over.</p>

<p>It was to this country, and during this pause in the conflict, that
the Thirteenth were diverted from their work in France. The
diversion was of course a disappointment. The Regiment could no
longer hope to join in the coming triumph on the Western Front.
Not for them the grand pursuit to the Rhine, and on over German
country to the gates of Berlin, and the final march Unter den
Linden. It was hard to give up such a prospect. But it has
been shown in what spirit the order was received. They were
soldiers, and their duty was to do their best wherever they might
be most useful to the country. If they were more wanted in the
East than on the Western Front, so be it.</p>

<p>And, after all, perhaps it might be as well for themselves.
The coming triumph in Europe might be long postponed, might
even turn out to be one for the Infantry and guns alone. In the
plains of Mesopotamia they might reasonably look for some Cavalry
ground&mdash;for some chance of striking a blow on horseback and
justifying their existence. There, at all events, they would not
have the work and the honour altogether taken out of their hands
by the airmen, who were to them what the eagle was to the horse,
and find themselves chafing in impotence while the enemy defied
them from the shelter of his trench lines, against which they were
as useless as unarmed men. Mesopotamia held out some hope to
the cavalryman who still believed in his arm. He might yet get
home with lance and sabre, and take his revenge upon the footmen
who had so long held him at a distance with fortifications and
“villainous saltpetre.” Asia had always been the land of the
horseman. Surely it would be so again.</p>

<p>And he was not wrong. Both in Mesopotamia and in Palestine,
horsemen were to strike heavy blows before the war ended.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.<br />

<span class="large">SUMMER IN LOWER MESOPOTAMIA.</span></h2>

<p>The voyage of the Thirteenth to Mesopotamia was uneventful but
not altogether pleasant, as any one can understand who has been on
board ship in the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf in the month of
July. A few extracts from diaries and letters will give some idea
of it.</p>

<p><i>Private Massey, “D” Squadron&mdash;Diary.</i>&mdash;“R&eacute;veill&eacute; was at 3 <small>A.M.</small> on
the morning of the 18th, and I was ordered to stay behind and load
the rifles and swords on the motor-lorry, and went down to the
docks on it afterwards, so I was saved a march of about four miles.
After reaching the docks, the Regiment commenced to embark the
horses and mules. All were soon on board, and at 11 o’clock
the ship, the <i>Islanda</i>, set sail, and it was a voyage I shall never
forget....”</p>

<p><i>July 23, 1916.</i>&mdash;“During the voyage we had the horses to water,
feed, and clean out their stalls, which involved a great deal of hard
work, besides which we had to get their forage out of the hold, and
carry it through no end of awkward gangways, and up and down flights
of stairs. Added to this was the awful food we had issued: there was
only half enough to supply the wants of the men, and what there was
was unfit to eat. The mutton we had served up had always to be
killed the same morning. The sheep were herded together in the
bow of the ship, and though they had shelter from the burning sun
the poor animals were nothing but skin and bone: little wonder we
could get no meat off the bones at meal-time. Complaints were
made, but it was of little use. Often at breakfast the porridge was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
spoilt in the cooking. I remember we were issued out with presents
from the ‘Ladies from the Presidency of Bombay,’ which included
cake, toffee, and games, but there was so few given to each troop
that the three sections in the troops decided to toss for it, and our
section won the games&mdash;deuced little comfort for a man with an
empty belly. I myself was so weak that I made sure my knees would
give way under the weight of my body, but the worst was yet to
come. We continued sailing all day of the 24th, and in the early
morning of the 25th July we arrived in close vicinity to the port of
embarkation [<i>sic</i>], and after waiting for an hour or two moved alongside
of the bank, and stopped against a sort of promenade which
reached out into deep water. Every one was glad to see land once
again, as it meant the chance of a decent meal anyway, for those
who had money. The sun was now beginning to make itself felt.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></p>

<p>“After we had anchored we commenced to disembark the horses
and mules. It was a slow and dangerous job, as horses were led
down a gangway from the ship to the land. Finally, the painful job
being finished, we next commenced to unload the saddles, after
having tied up the horses in a hurdles plot. I myself was stall
guard, and I had had to work in the blazing sun all morning. I
had to get into an empty stall to attend to the horse next to it, and
put my topee down on the deck so that I could get under the entrance,
and the horse put his foot on it, smashing the topee to bits.</p>

<p>“After we had finished the saddles it was getting late, but there
was a lot of hard work to do yet, and I do not remember stopping
for meals; even if we did, it was doubtless the same as the proceeding
[<i>sic</i>] days.</p>

<p>“Late at night, and lighted by lamps, we commenced to unload
limbers and guns, also two aeroplanes, from the hold of the ship.
Before commencing, we were issued with a pint of beer each, and
what was left over was taken down in a ship’s jug: thus we were
able to get a refresher now and again, and it did us a great deal of
good. It was 4 <small>A.M.</small> of the 26th before we had finished. R&eacute;veill&eacute;
was at 5 o’clock, so we had an hour in which to rest.</p>

<p>“We lay down on the tables, the benches, and the floor; the
hour soon went, when we got up, and proceeded to unload kit and
equipment, then had breakfast, and then commenced to water the
horses, and immediately prepared to leave for the camp, which was
about four miles away.”</p>

<p>Such was Private Massey’s remembrance of the voyage, and if
he grumbled a little, as is the way of the British soldier when he is
not fighting, it must be admitted that he did a long day’s work for
his “shilling and grub.” No forty-hours week for him on a six-pound
wage.</p>

<p>Lance-Corporal Bowie’s account of the voyage is short: “The
voyage to Basrah was uneventful, one horse only being lost from the
effect of the heat”; and his Colonel sums it up in exactly the same
words.</p>

<p>Another officer writes before the start, giving such news as
Bombay could supply about Mesopotamia. The port was full of
sick and wounded officers and men sent back from there. Their
reports were not unfavourable.</p>

<p><i>Captain Eve.</i>&mdash;“I gather it is hot and unpleasant just now, but
quite all right. Vegetables and fruits are the great want.... There
is a lot of shooting, they say, and pig, and there is also excellent
fishing, so we ought to have some fun.” But evidently the heat was
not negligible, for “We were all issued with Cawnpore topees instead
of our helmets, as they say they are necessary for Mesopotamia, and
I drew one like the men’s. We wear the Regimental colours on
them....</p>

<p>“To-morrow I start at six, when 236 horses arrive by train from
Deolali, where they have been collected from all over the place. I
expect most of them will be partly trained anyhow. There will be
half for ‘D’ and half for ‘A,’ and I shall simply take the first 118 and
let ‘A’ have the other 118. We can pick them out properly if we
decide to at the other end. There are also 75 mules arriving&mdash;the
whole of the Regimental transport&mdash;so there will be plenty to do,
and I shall be quite content. We shall have to work to-morrow
morning. They will be here by six, have breakfast, and then start
away, and the ship has to be out of the docks by eleven.... There
is practically no room for exercise at all, but it is only a short
voyage. I do hope we have luck and don’t lose many....”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span></p>

<p><i>July 23, 1916.</i>&mdash;“All is really well, all of us and the horses very fit
and flourishing. I am so pleased, and hoping with luck to get all safely
ashore.... It was a wickedly hot night the one I wrote to you in
the docks. I got to bed about 12.45, but could not sleep a wink, with
the heat and the noise and thinking about next day. I got up
again about 4.45 and was down before 6, and we worked like anything;
the men were first-class, and we had no trouble with horses or
mules, and were all aboard by 11 <small>A.M.</small> It was extraordinarily lucky
I went round myself the evening before, for I found both the ramps
leading below for the horses from the upper deck were made too low
to let anything but a pony in. Of course I made trouble and had
to have both altered.... Things worked beautifully.... 25 chargers
and 235 horses and 84 mules.... The mules we put on board first,
a very mixed lot, mostly in poor condition, some very big, some
small, but I think they will be all right. The horses we simply took
straight from the train on board.... They seem to be all walers,<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a>
and a small lot on the whole&mdash;some very weedy and light of bone,
not many common ones, and a few showing a lot of quality; very few
though showing much scope or size, and the majority of them in
distinctly poor light condition. They look very healthy, and well
in their coats....</p>

<p>“We could hardly be more comfortable than we are on this ship.
She is the best for horses I have ever seen&mdash;the men are very
comfortable, and so are we.... There is a lovely head breeze and
it is blowing right through the ship, and it isn’t at all bad below,
and all is as well as possible, and if only it goes on like this we shall,
I hope, bring all in safe and well. Every one said it would be
terrible....</p>

<p>“To-day we might get wireless news from Aden or from B.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> How
I do hope we may. You can’t tell how we want news.... This
evening we are going to have a men’s concert on the boat deck,
8 to 9.30....</p>

<p>“We are as fit as fleas, sweating like anything of course, but I
don’t seem to feel it and am ever so fit, and never been so comfortable
and content on a voyage.... Every one wears shorts, and they are
a great comfort....”</p>

<p><i>July 25.</i>&mdash;“Everything has worked most awfully well, and we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
are now, 7.45 <small>A.M.</small>, well on our way up the river.... Last night was
terribly hot. I went below myself about 1 o’clock, and a lot of
horses were blowing badly and we had them out in the hatchways.
But they got through the night well.... There is a most lovely fresh
head breeze, and it is as cool as anything. The river here is wide,
and we are able to full-speed ahead, but so far it is the most terrible
unhealthy-looking place&mdash;palm groves very low lying, mud, and sand.
Of course this is only the delta. It ought to be much more interesting
farther up....</p>

<p>“I can’t write proper letters from here, because I am told all
officers’ letters are invariably opened and read right through by the
Censor....</p>

<p>“We anchored about 1 <small>P.M.</small>, and then moved on about 3.15 to
our berth, and got tied up about 4.30 to the most ramshackle wooden
pier&mdash;everything truly Eastern, you know what I mean. Luckily
there was a good bridge down the river. I disembarked the horses,
all down one gangway, in about 1 hour 20 minutes, and put them in
sort of railed paddocks on shore. It was very hot. We then got to
work at baggage, all the regimental transport, &amp;c., a terrible long,
slow business, and we worked the whole night, and I lay down for
three-quarters of an hour. The men and we slept on board, a guard
with the horses on shore. They came off all fit and well, only two
with any temperature. The rest of the Regiment came in a few
hours later and started disembarking too. They lost one horse <i>en
route</i>. I saw the Colonel, who seemed very content. We were at
it from 4 next morning, and finally got all ashore about 7.30.”</p>

<p>So the voyage ended, and the Thirteenth were safely landed in
Mesopotamia, just twenty-eight days after leaving Marseilles. But the
first few months in the country were not agreeable. The heat was
great, and there was no news or excitement of any kind, nothing to do
but to get the men and the new horses fit for the campaign, if there was
to be a campaign, when the weather allowed of movement. For the
present the Turks were not giving any trouble. Since the capture
of Kut they had seemed content to sit quiet, waiting for the British
to try another attack if so disposed. Meanwhile, they strengthened
the defensive positions on the Tigris, from which they had inflicted
so many bloody repulses upon the invaders of their country, and
hoped to inflict more. They did not realise that affairs had changed,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
that troops and guns and equipment of all kinds were pouring in
from the sea, and that the attack when it came would be a very
different matter from the hasty frontal assaults in the mud, by small
forces, which they had beaten off before. The British War Office
had now taken over from the Indian Government the control of the
expedition, and the whole resources of England were being set in
motion to provide the British force with all the things necessary for
modern war, and above all, with ample transport for land and river.</p>

<p>The Thirteenth at first suffered considerably. The letter-book
from which I have quoted goes on to speak of the move from shipboard
into camp.</p>

<p><i>Captain Eve.</i>&mdash;“It was very hot, and we got in about 11 to find
our camp on the edge of the desert, about three miles off and a mile
from the river. All of us in the usual E. P. large Indian tents,<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> horses
in the open, all pretty uncomfortable at first. The men felt it
terribly, and about eight or ten of D went down with heat-stroke on
the way up, including Sergeant Hill. Pearson was knocked over the
night before on the ship and went to hospital, as did all the men,
of course. Next day we spent getting straight more or less, and
only led the horses out. They felt the heat terribly, and poor
Mam’zelle and one or two horses in the squadron died, and several
others in the Regiment too. It was very heart-breaking. Three men
in the squadron died, and two or three others in the Regiment....
I must go and get inoculated for cholera now. Back again. The
horses are a moderate lot, still they were much better than I expected.
I had hardly any men the first few days, and we were very hard
worked. The men simply went down like flies with the heat. It
was partly after the long time without exercise....</p>

<p>“The rest of the day has been wretched&mdash;a blinding filthy sand
and desert storm, everything smothered in layers of filth.... Every
one remarks on how well I look. Things were uncomfortable at first,
and most people seemed to feel the heat very much; but I never did,
and have been ever so fit all along and with a tremendous appetite.</p>

<p>“They have now built long matting-roofed stables for the
horses, who are improving visibly.... The dust is simply unbelievable.
The only thing beyond desert is date-palm groves, but I am
certain here at any rate it is healthy. We have a field force
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
canteen quite close, so while we are here shan’t need any of our
weekly supplies, but shall keep everything in reserve. Also the
rations are very good, both porridge and bacon and fresh meat quite
often, and things like dried apricots, figs, &amp;c., and potatoes. We
can buy bread here. The ration is all biscuit....”</p>

<p>The officer commanding the Regiment, Colonel Richardson,
dismisses the period in a very few words. “Our arrival,” he
writes, “coincided with a severe heat-wave, and during the first
four days about forty cases of heat-stroke occurred, of which ten
proved fatal. For the next three months we were stationary in
this camp, training and acclimatising horses and men. The men
lived in E. P. tents, and after the first fortnight suffered comparatively
little from the heat, the cool nights proving a great boon
to every one. The chief maladies with which we had to contend
were fever, diarrhœa, and septic sores.”</p>

<p>Private Massey’s account of the heat-wave is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“In the blazing heat of a tropical sun we started, each man
leading two horses, besides two haversacks, bandolier containing
ninety rounds of ball ammunition, a water-bottle, and a rifle and
bayonet.</p>

<p>“On and on we trekked, men falling out by the way with heat-stroke,
many stark mad, and men were told off to hold the poor
devils down, whilst the motor ambulances raced away with them
to hospital at Ashar.... On getting into camp we tied up the
horses, and after stables the squadron leader, Captain Eve, told us
we had had a very hard time getting off the boat, and thanked us
for what we had done, telling us that such things were likely to
happen on active service. The same night the orderly corporal
reported Private Tarr had died in hospital.... We were glad to get
into the tents, and lie down, and drink lots of iced water.</p>

<p>“Next day, the 27th, Private Killackey was reported dead.
Many others went sick the next few days, some of them
dying....</p>

<p>“Thus ended the month of July, but from this time onwards
things began to get better, and the men were getting better food,
but there was a big percentage of sick amongst the Regiment, and
men occasionally became delirious.”</p>

<p>It certainly was a rough beginning, but the men seem to have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
acclimatised rapidly. The Regiment had considerable work in
training the hastily provided remounts, some of which stampeded
and got lost; but by the end of September the training was completed,
and the Thirteenth were almost fit for active service again. In
October some regimental and Brigade drills and musketry put on
the final polish. Doubtless the fine physique of the men had much
to do with their quick return to health. Just before they landed to
face the Mesopotamian heat, one of their officers had written:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>2nd Lieutenant Guy Pedder&mdash;July 24.</i>&mdash;“It was 100&deg; in the
shade this morning, but they say they often get 118&deg; and 120&deg;
where we are going, and of course the trouble is, there isn’t much
shade, so it is generally 150&deg; to 160&deg;....</p>

<p>“All the men wear next to nothing, probably a thin vest and a
thin pair of pants: I never realised before what a magnificent lot of
men they are, their physique is marvellous; of course, they ought
to be, as they are the original old Army plus K.’s best men....</p>

<p>“There is a decent breeze this morning, and it’s just like a heat
from an oven striking you in the face!...”</p>

<p>Some further letters from officers of the Regiment will show
how the summer passed.</p>

<p><i>Captain Eve&mdash;August 3.</i>&mdash;“Here we are likely to remain for
the next six weeks or so, training our horses and getting them
fit. We are under canvas, and the horses in straw-matting
stabling.... It is of course very hot, but it is very dry heat, and
the nights are cool.... Dust and sand-storms are the worst
thing....</p>

<p>“I have got young Pedder, a very nice fellow, transferred to
me, and am now full up again with officers and have a very good
squadron....”</p>

<p><i>2nd Lieutenant Pedder&mdash;August 3.</i>&mdash;“We are staying here for at
least two months in a desert about four miles from where we
disembarked.... I have got no news: there is none out here,
every day is precisely the same as the one before.... There’s
a hot sand-storm raging this morning: we get it pretty regularly
every day. I have got hold of one very nice new horse; of course
all these horses are untrained, so we have an awful job with them.
Yes, Stirling is all right, and Munster, who fell out at Port Said,
has rejoined us.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span></p>

<p><i>Captain Eve&mdash;August 3.</i>&mdash;“We all wear neck-shades on our
Cawnpore helmets, and all wear spine-pads and short sleeves. Later
we shall wear our coats, but now no one does, and the men have
khaki shorts too....</p>

<p>“I bought what they call a ch&aacute;gal in Bombay, a canvas bag
for water, which you hang up full, and which keeps cool. We
have all had them issued to us as well, so we are well off. They
are invaluable, and the drinking-water is good, and we mostly live
on that, some with lime-juice and tea....</p>

<p>“You have no idea the dust, heat, and discomfort in which
I write. If the letter arrives in a mucky state you will know.
You don’t know what a sand-storm is like, and that with real
heat and all the sand turning to dirty mud under one’s hands and
arms when one was sweating, and one’s indelible pencil staining
one all over for the same reason.”</p>

<p>The heat, apparently, was more than uncomfortable, for in spite
of the writer’s hearty appetite and contentment, and the sober
joys of the “ch&aacute;gal” (which, by the way, rhymes approximately
with “gargle,” as “jangal” becomes “jungle”), his letters for the
next fortnight are written from hospital in Basra. Still they are
contented enough.</p>

<p>“I shall be very comfortable indeed here, and shall stop till
both my complaints are really right. This is a nice high, big,
cool building right on the river, with electric fans, and light, and
all that sort of thing&mdash;in fact, civilised comforts.”</p>

<p>The Thirteenth were certainly fortunate in that way, that they
came to Mesopotamia too late to share the horrible discomforts and
sufferings endured by the sick and wounded during the campaigns
of 1914 and 1915, before the medical arrangements had been fully
organised.</p>

<p>“The General came to see me last evening, and sat talking a
long time. I thought it so nice of him. But he really is simply
charming....</p>

<p>“I feel fairly well this morning&mdash;just a bit weak and tired, of
course. The great thing is the comfort here. A tent in the
desert is not a paradise when you are feeling ill.”</p>

<p><i>Lieutenant Munster&mdash;August 4.</i>&mdash;“The heat is not as bad as I
expected. Dust is the great trouble at the moment....
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span></p>

<p>“I do not think I can compare this place to anything I have
ever seen. There are little creeks off the river, and the banks are
covered with date-palms, but a little way from the river there is
nothing but dust.</p>

<p>“A few Bombay shops have opened branches in the town, and
we can get most things that we want&mdash;of course, at a high price.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Munster must have had a contented disposition in
regard to climate, for another officer writes:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lieutenant Chrystall&mdash;August 4.</i>&mdash;“We are close to the Garden
of Eden. We cannot go outside from 9 till 5 owing to the
heat, which is now 120&deg; in the shade. The flies and mosquitoes
are positively awful, and sand-storms are the order every day; water
is at a premium and is rationed out, so you see everything in the
Garden is not lovely.”</p>

<p><i>Captain Eve&mdash;August 16.</i>&mdash;“First all is well&mdash;no need to worry. I
am convalescent, as I knew I soon should be, and am now (moved
yesterday) in the Officers’ Convalescent Hospital, about four miles
down the river from Basra, and feeling very fit and well. I expect
I shall be here a week; it’s a really nice place&mdash;large two-storied
bungalow facing on the river: I don’t intend going back till I am
really fit.</p>

<p>“There is no news at all here: one is buried in an absolute
backwater, and there is nothing at all going on out here, not a
shot being fired by us or the Turks, I believe. Occasionally there
are Arabs to be dealt with, but that’s all. They are always
scrapping either among themselves or with some one else.... I
believe we shall do no more fighting with the Turk&mdash;that he’ll
most probably have chucked it before the time when we could do
anything real here comes along. I look upon this just as an exile
like India.... Sometimes it is hard to be really keen about the
training one does, feeling as I do about things here, though there
is really tons to be done.... I wish one could know more, but I
will always be hopeful, and, oh! I pray for the end, though I
hardly see it in sight yet. But one never knows.”</p>

<p><i>2nd Lieutenant Guy Pedder&mdash;August 17.</i>&mdash;“We had a small
stampede here the other day, 3 troops clearing off into the desert;
however, after many searchings we have retrieved all except 7
horses. The Shemal (strong north wind which covers everything
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
with dust) is still going strong (supposed to last 40 days&mdash;it has
been on 21 days now). We get a fortnight’s intense heat, then it
gradually gets cold, and in December there is a freezing wind which
goes through you apparently. You would laugh to see us walking
about in the daytime (when we have to) in stockings, shorts,
shirts, sunshade, spine-protector, goggles, and a large umbrella,
khaki!”</p>

<p><i>Captain Eve&mdash;August 21.</i>&mdash;“The rest of the Brigade is arriving
at once, but I doubt if we shall leave here for a month yet.
It is dull, but really a good thing, for there is such a lot to
be done, with all new horses and so on, and then one wants to get
all one’s men well acclimatised. As it is, there are a good many
still in hospital, but they’ll mostly be coming out soon.</p>

<p>“Lake, who has been in command out here, leaves to-day ...
and I believe we are to get Cobbe, lately on the Staff with us, the
Indian Cavalry Corps, in France.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></p>

<p>“The worst of the hot weather is about over, and it is slowly
getting cooler now. It is anyhow infinitely better than India. Here
at the base we are doing ourselves pretty well. It is up at the
Front when trouble begins, owing to the great shortcomings in the
transport.”</p>

<p><i>August 23.</i>&mdash;“First, I am out of hospital, and back at work
with the Regiment, and ever so fit and well. Next, I have got
Caprice,<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> and was riding her this morning.... Caprice is of course
looking a bit pulled down and poor, but has still good stuff on her,
and is very lively, and bright, and hungry, and searching me for
sugar, which I haven’t got here.”</p>

<p>No, the end was not in sight yet, nor would be for two years
longer, and meanwhile the Turk was to do much stiff fighting,
and the writer was to ride Caprice yet through some long days of it.</p>

<p><i>Lieutenant Chrystall&mdash;August 24.</i>&mdash;“The heat is very bad to-day,
and you find me writing this under a mosquito-net at 3 <small>P.M.</small>
The flies are awful, and without a net writing would be impossible.
I am lying practically stark naked, and am sweating buckets!
Bathing is carried on in a very primitive form. I stand on a sack
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
(after dark, of course) and simply sponge myself all over from a horse
bucket&mdash;it is the best one can do, and it really is not half bad.”</p>

<p><i>Captain Eve&mdash;August 30.</i>&mdash;“Still a very large sick list among
the men, but the weather is better and the nights cool....
Of course all the middle of the days one can do absolutely nothing.
That is one of the great trials of the East to me....</p>

<p>“We have nothing definite about moving yet, nothing but
rumours. The great difficulties out here are transport and supply,
and at this time of year the river is at its lowest, which, of course,
makes great extra trouble.”</p>

<p>These Mesopotamian rivers, the only real lines of communication,
were in fact very difficult to use. In the hot season they
became so shallow that even flat-bottomed steamers of small
draught found it hard to avoid sticking on their innumerable loops
and sand-banks. At the same time, though there was some dry
ground, troops could not march on account of the heat. When,
on the contrary, it rained, the dry ground rapidly turned to deep
alluvial mud, or was even covered with water, while the rivers
became too swift for boats unless very powerful and handy.</p>

<p><i>Lieutenant Munster&mdash;August 31.</i>&mdash;“We carry out the same routine&mdash;early
parade, and then slack about in the tent till about 5 o’clock.
Some people shoot in the evening. I believe there are some
pigeons about. There is moderate fishing here as well.... Perhaps
I shall begin to learn to knock a polo-ball about soon. A few people
play in the desert in a rough sort of way.”</p>

<p><i>September 7.</i>&mdash;“We are still at the base. I have just got a pony.
We are each allowed one to carry pack-saddles, and they have been
selected with a view to polo: probably we shall play quite a lot
later on.”</p>

<p>Poor boy. His experience of polo was to be a very short one.</p>

<p><i>Lieutenant Chrystall&mdash;September 7.</i>&mdash;“We are getting much cooler
weather now&mdash;although the desert is not the ideal spot to live
in.... The nights are generally good.”</p>

<p><i>2nd Lieutenant Guy Pedder&mdash;September 14.</i>&mdash;“Last Monday it
was 112&deg; in the shade in our hut, and yesterday it was never
higher than 89&deg;, and dropped to 45&deg; at night; everybody turned into
bed early, and most people pulled their beds into their tents and
then slept in a blanket.... It is much cooler now altogether, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
at night one realises how cold it is going to be in six weeks
or so....”</p>

<p><i>Lieutenant Chrystall&mdash;September 26.</i>&mdash;“We have just got a patent
fly-trap in the mess, a Japanese thing which slowly revolves a
wooden wheel on which you place sugar and lime-juice: the flies
are gradually dropped over into a cage. This is a great invention
and catches them by the handful.... Our sick list is diminishing
now, I am glad to say, as it does make work so hard for the men,
having about five horses to look after. This country is remarkably
good for horses, and they do very well except for a sort of biliary
fever.”</p>

<p><i>2nd Lieutenant J. O. P. Clarkson&mdash;Amara, Mesopotamia&mdash;October
15.</i>&mdash;“I’ve been sent up here on a course for a few days. I
came up by river. We passed Ezra’s tomb: there is not very much
to see really; we were allowed inside, but had to take our shoes off.
The boat was rather wide, rather like a Thames paddle-steamer,
except they have a second storey to them, and are open all round.
They are boats that used to be on the Irawaddi before the War.
We churned up the river, with a barge in tow on either side, and in
this manner we went right up-stream. We often bumped into the
banks of the river, especially at the turns, and there are some very
nasty ones. Some were absolutely hairpin turns, and some were
lively S-bends, so between the two we had quite a lovely time
bumping into the banks. After we had got a short way up the
Tigris we went at a walking pace for a whole day&mdash;that was in the
narrows. There are plenty of Arab villages, and the whole
population would turn out offering us chickens and eggs. We had
the band of the 104th going up on the same boat, so we had music
every evening. The Arabs used to love the band, and would run
alongside the boat and jump and dance and shout and clap their
hands. One evening when the band was playing we came across
a large band of Arabs building a railway or something; anyway when
they heard the music they didn’t exactly ‘down tools,’ but picked
them up, stopped work, and came rushing up and down and waved
their spades, &amp;c., in the air.</p>

<p>“We are billeted in an Arab house, and on the other side is
the Club, which has been well organised. There are several concert
troupes here, and they are very good.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span></p>

<p><i>Captain Eve&mdash;October 18.</i>&mdash;“We have not moved yet, but I
hope and think we shan’t be long. It is still very hot in the afternoons,
but the mornings are good now, and so are the nights. We
are very busy and all very fit, but very heartily sick of this place,
and looking forward to a move, and to the march, which should be
great fun&mdash;they always are&mdash;and to the chance of some good shooting
<i>en route</i>. We are ready, but have no orders yet. The river is still
very low, but should rise a foot next month. This makes all the
difference. This whole campaign is a question of transport and
supplies&mdash;the great difficulty of getting the latter.</p>

<p>“I don’t expect we go farther than Amara, a ten days’ march,
at present, as that is, I fancy, the farthest point which full supplies
reach yet. But anyhow that will be part way, and a welcome change.
This spot is, of course, the worst out here for climate. It is degrees
cooler and healthier farther up. Still we have a very small sick list
now, though we have lost a lot of men since we got here.</p>

<p>“Horses do wonderfully well here, and look, and are, as fit as
fleas. Of course they are on a full and very good ration here, so
they ought to do well. It’s for their sakes entirely that I don’t want
to go farther up than full supplies are getting to. I can imagine no
greater misery than seeing one’s horses slowly starving on half
rations.... I go on the river in the evening sometimes, generally
in a <i>bellum</i> (native boat) ... something like a gondola, worked by
punting or paddles. The river is full of life these days, tremendous
activity, and there is always something to see. Also it’s a great
relief after the desert.”</p>

<p><i>2nd Lieutenant Guy Pedder&mdash;October 25.</i>&mdash;“Anniversary of Balaclava,
1854. To-day is a whole holiday, as the Regiment took part in
the charge of the Light Brigade. This evening there’s a hockey
match, officers <i>v.</i> sergeants. I am playing, but rather funk it, as
I’m so stiff after playing ‘D <i>v.</i> B’ Squadron yesterday. It was a
draw, 0&mdash;0. We went out grouse-shooting this morning.”</p>

  </tr></table>

<p><i>Lieutenant Chrystall&mdash;October 30.</i>&mdash;“Our messing arrangements
out here are rather funny. I have to beg, borrow, or steal firewood,
as there is absolutely not a stick in the country; everything
has to come from India, even firewood. Then meat is awfully scarce,
and of course tough, like leather. You also see me chasing a poor
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
unfortunate misshapen chicken, and falling over a tent rope in
endeavouring to collar it, in true ‘Rugger’ style.”</p>

<p><i>2nd Lieutenant Guy Pedder&mdash;November 2.</i>&mdash;“We really are moving
to-morrow and have got a long march in front of us. It is
very hot again, but the nights are very cold. Just been given (every
officer gets one on going up-country) a sackful of war gifts&mdash;thick
pyjamas, boots, fly-nets, shaving-soap, books, eatables, &amp;c., &amp;c.&mdash;ripping
things.... Played polo for the Regiment yesterday, and a
very good farewell concert last night.”</p>

<p>So ended the summer training in camp, and the comparative
inaction for the Thirteenth. Much of all this may seem trivial, and
no real part of the doings of the Regiment in the Great War. But
war, and especially a war of such magnitude, cannot be all fighting.
The greater part of any campaign is made up of comparatively
peaceful days, during which the soldier sees no shot fired. They
are none the less an important time, full of work, and yet not
without rest and pleasure, all of which have much to do with his
fitness when the fighting days come upon him. The months spent
in the desert camp at Basra, far from the front, had not been wasted.
The end of them found the Thirteenth in good health and spirits,
with men hardened to the climate and horses properly trained.
They had two trying years in front of them, years in which they
were to see much rough fighting and hardship. It was fortunate
for them that they had had this breathing space before being thrown
into the actual conflict.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.<br />

<span class="large">MARCH TO THE FRONT&mdash;MAUDE’S PLAN OF CAMPAIGN.</span></h2>

<p>On the 3rd of November, the 7th Cavalry Brigade marched out
of their desert camp and set their faces northward. The Brigade
marched in four echelons, of which the Hussars formed the fourth.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_124fp" src="images/i_124fp.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">ON THE TIGRIS</p></div>

<p>There was nothing particularly exciting about the march. It
was a pleasant change from the life of a stationary camp, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
Regiment passed some interesting places on the Mesopotamian
rivers, among them the alleged site of the Garden of Eden, near
the junction of the Tigris and Euphrates&mdash;a dreary spot now. “No
wonder the Twelve Apostles deserted,” was, according to General
MacMunn, a British soldier’s comment on seeing it. Farther up on
the bank of the Tigris was Ezra’s tomb. “The most beautiful of
all vignettes is the hedge-sparrow dome ... set in a small grove
of palms.” Throughout this country, and Persia, the little blue-tiled
domes under a cloudless sky are a familiar feature. And all along
the line of march were points which had acquired some fame in the
recent campaigns, before the Thirteenth joined the Expeditionary
Force. Here and there some enterprising sportsmen found a little
game, which went to swell the camp pot. But there was no fighting&mdash;the
Turks being still to the northward and still inactive,
awaiting attack, while the Arab natives of the country gave no
trouble beyond occasionally trying to steal rifles at night, which
made it necessary to keep a careful watch and form specially arranged
night camps.</p>

<p>The following extracts from letters give a more personal touch,
and show the daily course of affairs on the way up.</p>

<p><i>Captain W. H. Eve&mdash;November 1, 1916.</i>&mdash;“We have finally got
our orders.... Each day we march in the morning of course, and
we camp on arrival in a square&mdash;what is called a perimeter camp.
The plan for ours is,
<img class="table" id="i_125" src="images/i_125.jpg" alt="" />
AH, BH, CH, DH show the Hotchkiss guns of each squadron. We
take over more than 300 remounts to lead up with us as far as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
Amara. They come here immediately before we start. The squadron
gets 80 as its share. It will mean pretty hard work for the unfortunate
men. We have got any amount of transport&mdash;in fact I
hardly know how we shall fill it.... So we shall travel in tremendous
comfort, and cart along all our luxuries, such as tables, chairs,
&amp;c.... The horses do look well. My own are pictures, and the
whole squadron is a pleasure to go round.”</p>

<p><i>November 6.</i>&mdash;“I have to write to-day to catch the mail from
this place, Kurna, where we are just settling down, 1.15 <small>P.M.</small>, with
a very nice camp in some palm-trees by the river. I am enjoying
myself now, though the first couple of days were uncomfortable....
We had taken over a batch of remounts before we started, 80 per
squadron&mdash;all but half a dozen great cart-horses for gunners. They
are very quiet, most of them, but it means nearly double work for
the men, and they have all to be led with halters only, and lots of
the men are leading two, so you can imagine what it is like. How
thankful I shall be when we drop them at Amara.... Those that
are not heavy draught are ponies for infantry chargers.</p>

<p>“Saturday was a horrid day, cloudy, strong south wind, and
trying to rain, and very sticky; ... yesterday, Sunday, was the
same sort of day.... We had a long bridge of boats to cross over
the old Euphrates into Kurna, and that took time.... This is far
and away the nicest camp we have had, in fact the only nice one,
and we are very comfortable here.... We are on the right bank
west still, but cross to the other before we get to Amara. The
palms end here, and there is corn, &amp;c., on the banks. The new
railway is here close beside us, this section apparently about
finished, but I don’t know how far. We are getting our soda-waters
refilled at the hospital here.”</p>

<p>The new railway was one of the many works undertaken to
strengthen the communications of the army, and make it movable
and feedable when the time for the advance should come. With
a railway behind him, and a fleet of river steamers, the new General
was to be in a very different position from his unfortunate predecessors,
pressing on with insufficient numbers and supplies in
desperate endeavours to relieve the starving garrison of Kut.</p>

<p><i>2nd Lieutenant Guy Pedder&mdash;Garden of Eden&mdash;November 6.</i>&mdash;“Just
got in and hear there is a mail out at 7 to-morrow, so just
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
a short line to tell you I am very fit. This morning we started at
9 and did not get here till 3.30. I had a bathe, and then went for
three or four miles with a gun to see if I could find any partridges or
snipe, but saw nothing. This is our fourth day’s march, and we
are at last in Mesopotamia proper (<i>i.e.</i>, land in between the two
rivers). It’s awfully pretty here, and we are right on the Tigris.
Yesterday Box (Jeffrey) and I got permission to walk from the
second camp to the third in the hopes of getting some shooting;
we started off one and a half hours before the Regiment, and got
in one hour after it, and walked about fifteen miles. I enjoyed it
very much, but we saw only four brace of partridges, and got two
and a half brace. At the next camp I believe there is some good
duck-shooting.</p>

<p>“The march is rather spoilt as we’ve got 300 remounts to lead,
and so it just doubles the amount of work for the men; however,
we drop the remounts in six days’ time at Amara.</p>

<p>“Yesterday it actually rained, or tried to, for 2 or 3 minutes.
I haven’t put up my 80-lb. tent yet this march; it’s perfect sleeping
out in the open still, as long as one has three or four blankets on
one’s camp-bed, as I do.</p>

<p>“Dinner!</p>

<p>“Later. Perfect night to-night; have been for a stroll on the
river promenade; very tired, so must turn in as r&eacute;veill&eacute; is at 5.30
to-morrow. Boiling hot again to-day, very fit but very tired, so
night-night.”</p>

<p><i>Amara, November 12.</i>&mdash;“Just a very hurried line, as post goes
at 7 to-morrow, to say I am very fit, after 150 miles; we have been
just ten days getting to Amara. I have hardly marched with the
Regiment at all, as each day I and one or two others have got leave
to shoot independently on to the next camp; to-day, for instance,
Twist, Jeffrey, and I left the last camp at eight and shot our way
here, getting about fifty head. I got 5 brace of partridges, 4 couple of
snipe, 5 sand-grouse, and 1 duck&mdash;a great day. We arrived here two
hours after the Regiment, whom we never saw once on the way....
This seems a topping place, but we go on another six miles to-morrow
and join the Brigade: how long we shall be there no one knows at
present. I have enjoyed the march like anything, bar one or two
nights when we struck thousands of mosquitoes. Thank goodness
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
we have handed over all the remounts we had to bring up here and
which delayed us so. The last two or three days I have been
wading about in shorts after duck and snipe. It is very cold at
night now, but still very hot between 12 and 3. Had a tremendous
dinner to-night&mdash;soup, whole partridge and peas, boiled mutton, onion
sauce and beans, tinned peaches and rice, a snipe, followed by a cigar
and a bowl of cocoa.... The sand-grouse came over to-day in
swarms and blackened the whole sky, most of them much too high;
must turn in now as I am dead tired.”</p>

<p><i>Captain W. H. Eve&mdash;Amara&mdash;November 12.</i>&mdash;... “To-day
we have marched fifteen miles to this place and didn’t get in till about
1.30, and then went straight on to the Remount Depot and handed
over the remounts&mdash;thank goodness! It’s been rather a rotten march
so far, spoilt by these remounts, which have made a terrible lot of
work and caused us to march very slowly, only at a walk, and it
has been very hard indeed on the men and very tiring for all of
us.... The flies and mosquitoes at some of our camps have been
wicked. I should think this is quite a nice place [Amara], but have
hardly had time to see. Our shooting has been spoilt by our being
the last lot of four, and now we can only shoot with an escort, which
I shall hate, so I don’t suppose we shall do very much. They say
there aren’t any pig to be found till the rains, when they all get
flooded out into the desert. We have been through all sorts of
country, a lot very dreary dry marsh, but some very nice, like
moorland, short turf and thick scrub. Hardly any just sandy desert
since the first few days.</p>

<p><i>November 14.</i>&mdash;... “We left the dirty camp at Amara at
8.30 yesterday and marched out here, about 6&frac12; miles up-stream, just
on the bend of the river. This is a really nice camp. The country
is short heathy turf covered with camel thorn, but all very dry and
hard now, and on the opposite bank are gardens and palm groves....
The camp is really as in peace-time, and they have trumpet-calls
and all that sort of thing. There are no enemy near except Arab
rifle thieves.... I suppose we shall start regular work here very
soon, but we shan’t be able to do so much with the horses, as they
only get 3 lb. of hay, the rest <i>bhoosa</i> (chopped straw), and only 10
or 11 lb. of grain&mdash;uncrushed barley and bran.... I am so cosy
and comfortable in my 80-lb. tent&mdash;the same as we had in India.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
We have moved the whole of our tents and the mess right up on
to the river bank, where all the officers now are, and we have fixed
up one mess-tent with the river side of it up horizontally and open
to the river, and it is very nice.... We are under orders to hold
ourselves in readiness to move from to-morrow, but no orders have
come, so I’m afraid we are not off yet. But a big native boat has been
secured for the Brigade in which some of the heavy kit is being
carried.”</p>

<p><i>November 15.</i>&mdash;“Away to the east you can plainly see the
Persian foothills about forty miles off.</p>

<p>“We are all right so far for rations ourselves, getting fresh meat
quite often, and a full allowance; but our unfortunate horses are
now on three-quarter rations of grain only, and that uncrushed
barley, and hardly any hay, with a little chopped straw in turn.
We hope when the railway is finished this may be put right, but
it is bad at present, and means we dare do very little with them.
The railway is finished in great parts, and they hoped would be
through this month. Let’s only hope so....</p>

<p>“The nights are cold, but the days still hot, much more so than
I expected. That’s what makes the climate trying, the tremendous
changes during the twenty-four hours. But I think it’s very
healthy up here, and we are all very fit and flourishing, and hardly
any sickness among the men either. My only anxiety is my poor
horses.</p>

<p>“They have got canteens going now both here [and] at the Front,
so we can replenish always, and are doing ourselves quite well.”</p>

<p><i>Lieutenant Chrystall&mdash;November 19.</i>&mdash;“We have passed through
the Garden of Eden, and a sterile beastly place it looks; and how
old Adam existed Heaven only knows, for there is nothing to eat
except dates and dust! The next place we passed of interest was
the tomb of Ezra, one of the minor prophets? ’Tis a great place of
pilgrimage for the Jews. One finds the reading of the Old Testament
very interesting, as all the parts round about here are mentioned
therein, and also all the customs, &amp;c., and one can see many Abrahams
and Ishmaels with the flocks and herds moving over the desert and
round the banks of the river.”</p>

<p><i>Captain S. O. Robinson&mdash;November 19.</i>&mdash;“Since I last wrote we
have moved up the river some distance.... I believe that we are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
going up farther in a day or two&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, if they can supply us. Our
horses are on half-rations at present, but the men are well fed.</p>

<p>“I bought a cheap shot-gun in Bombay before we started, and it
has been very useful. There are plenty of sand-grouse and partridge
about, which make a very useful addition to the pot. The flies are
worse than ever.”</p>

<p><i>2nd Lieutenant Guy Pedder&mdash;November 19.</i>&mdash;“This letter ought to
reach you just before Christmas, so here are the best wishes for a
happy Christmas. I have certainly never written those words before
on as hot a day as to-day, ... and though I’ve written to Bombay
for a thousand cartridges I don’t know when I shall get them, and
I am practically out now, like every one else; it’s a rotten state of
affairs, as there are now thousands of ducks, geese, grouse, and the
farther one gets up-country naturally the shorter the rations get and
game is invaluable.... From the number of troops coming up-country,
I should think there ought to be a fairly good show out here,
but it is impossible to say. I am very fit, and am sleeping in my
tent on the edge of the Tigris, and have a swim when I get up at 7
every morning. I went into the Bazaar at Amara two days ago
and tried to find some curios to send home, and am sending a pair
of Arab stirrups and perhaps a bed quilt.... Played polo last night
and went out shooting this morning, and am going again this evening....
I enjoyed the march up here awfully, and am looking forward to
going on. Very fit, no news whatever.”</p>

<p><i>November 26.</i>&mdash;“A very tiny line to thank you for that ripping
waistcoat. I wear it every evening. I am sending home some
stirrups, but am keeping the bed quilt as it is so nice and warm....
Yesterday I got a beautiful hare, and we are having it
to-night ... in fact, we are pretty well living on game, and have
partridges and bacon even for breakfast ... but it will be more
difficult to cater when our cartridges are finished. Am very fit, and
have got rid of a filthy cold I had for a week, and have handed it
on to Eve. The men are very excited, as they think they are at
last going to have a show.”</p>

<p>The Regiment marched from Amara on the 28th November and
was moving steadily up the river Tigris towards the Front. Captain
Eve writes on the 1st December:&mdash;</p>

<p>“This march is as nice as the other one was nasty, and I am
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
thoroughly enjoying it, and the men are as cheery as crickets. The
General and Foster have gone on in front by boat, so the Colonel
is commanding the Brigade and Twist the Regiment. Also having
no remounts now to lead, we are able to trot along and march a
decent pace, and we go largely across country. It has nearly all so
far been heathy country with low thorn-scrub and lots of ditches,
and it is excellent for the men and horses.... We camp in a huge
square, always the same way.... We usually get in between 11.30
and 12, and then to stables, water, and feed. In the afternoon
shooting, &amp;c., but I haven’t been out, for I have only one cartridge
left. That is my only grouse.... Of course we have patrols all
round the camp at night and no one is allowed outside. Also at
5 every evening we all parade round the edge of the camp in the
places we should occupy in case of attack. The only thing to be
carefully watched for is Arab rifle thieves. I sleep with my pistol
inside my flea-bag with me.... Here we are about as close as we
ever get to the Persian hills&mdash;about twenty miles&mdash;and they are very
clear and look so nice when one is in a flat plain, though they
look very barren and bare. We aren’t on the river bank here,
though quite close. There is generally something to be seen on
the river, and the monitors look very workmanlike, and I like
seeing them....”</p>

<p><i>Arab Village&mdash;December 8.</i>&mdash;“Here we are at our destination
and all well.... Maude, who commands out here, came and
saw us march in.... General Headquarters is also here and
some other Divisions. The trenches are about 8000 yards forward
from here. We had an aeroplane over yesterday&mdash;a great shooting
but no luck, so I expect they know of our arrival by now. We have
two pontoon bridges over the river here, and there are other camps
on the north side as well.... A light railway runs up from Sheikh
Saad to the trenches.”</p>

<p>At last, therefore, the Thirteenth had reached the real Front.
The Regiment was then in excellent health and spirits, and in full
numerical strength. The list of officers shows Lieut.-Colonel J. J.
Richardson in command, Major E. F. Twist second in command,
four Captains, six Lieutenants, and sixteen 2nd Lieutenants&mdash;a young
lot, but perhaps none the worse for that. At Arab Village the
newly-arrived 7th Brigade and the 6th Brigade, which had been in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
the country over a year, were formed into a Cavalry Division under
Brigadier-General Crocker. The 6th Brigade consisted of the
Fourteenth Hussars and the 21st and 22nd Indian Cavalry. So, after
a lapse of a hundred years, the Thirteenth and Fourteenth, the old
Ragged Brigade of the Peninsular War, were again together on
service, but some thousands of miles away from Europe.</p>

<p>It has been noted that Lieut.-General Maude, who now commanded
the army in Mesopotamia, had met the 7th Brigade as
it marched into the camp at Arab Village, and that his own
Headquarters were there also.</p>

<p>General Maude had succeeded General Lake some months
earlier, and had now made all his preparations for a renewed
advance against the Turkish army, which ever since the fall of
Kut in April had flaunted its victorious banners in face of the
British invaders of Mesopotamia, and not only defied them to retake
the place, but threatened to strike out beyond them at Persia and
India.</p>

<p>Before giving an account of the memorable campaign that
followed, in which the Thirteenth Hussars bore an honourable part,
it may be well, at the risk of some repetition, to explain more fully
how matters stood when the advance began.</p>

<p>It has been said that the military power of the Turks in
Asia was in fact the Eastern wing of the great combination
organised by Germany for the conquest of the world. In Europe
the Germans, Austrians, and Bulgarians were to overthrow and
conquer the main armies of the Allies. In Asia the Turks, aided
by German officers and military resources, were to strike out eastward
and beat down such forces as the Allies could spare to meet them.
Russia was to be attacked in the Caucasus, Russia and England
were to be attacked in Persia, which was the highroad to India
also, and England was to be attacked in Egypt. The Turkish armies,
consisting of several hundred thousand men, securely based upon
Asia Minor, were thus to act upon three great Asiatic fronts&mdash;the
Caucasus on their left, Persia in the centre, Egypt on the
right.</p>

<p>Their lines of communication were no doubt long and imperfect,
for their railways were not complete; but holding the inner
position, the handle of the fan as it were, they were very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
favourably situated in comparison with the Allies, who had to meet
them by acting disconnectedly from outside the semicircle formed
by the open fan, while the Turks could strike from inside along
the spokes.</p>

<p>In 1914 and 1915 and 1916 there had been fighting on all three
fronts of the semicircle&mdash;on the Russian frontier towards the
Caucasus, the Turkish left; in Persia and Mesopotamia, the Turkish
centre; on the frontier of Egypt, the Turkish right. The fighting
had fluctuated, but it may be said roughly that on the two wings,
towards the Caucasus and towards Egypt, the position was stationary.
The Turks had held their own. In the centre they had pushed into
Persia and gained some partial success, but as an offset against
this, British forces coming from India by sea had landed in the
Turkish province contiguous to Persia, and had overrun a considerable
part of it. Even here, however, the most recent phase of
the war had ended in favour of the Turks. They had repulsed a
rash advance on the part of the British, and, shutting up in Kut
the force which made it, had beaten off with great slaughter all
British attempts at relief, and had finally captured a British Division
of 10,000 men. The total loss inflicted upon the British in these
operations had been over 30,000. In December 1916, therefore, the
prospects of the Turks on their central front were not unpromising.
Though they had not conquered Persia, still less succeeded in
seriously threatening India, they had made matters very unpleasant
for the British in Asia, and inflicted a severe blow upon British
prestige. During the hot weather of 1916 both sides had been
preparing for a renewal of the conflict upon this front, and the
campaign was now about to open.</p>

<p>Judging from a variety of indications, it seems clear that the
Turks and their German advisers had decided that the plan of the
coming campaign in Asia should be as follows. On their two wings,
towards the Caucasus and towards Egypt, the Turks were to content
themselves with holding their own, or gaining such success as
could be gained without any serious drain on their resources. There
was not any vital object to be attained by an advance in force upon
these fronts; or at all events a determined advance upon the central
front offered a greater chance of decisive results. If Persia could be
again invaded, with real success this time, and a Turkish army, or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
at least a vigorous propaganda, could be pushed on from Persia
through Afghanistan to the Indian frontier, the great object of the
Asiatic war, which was the overthrow of the British in India,
might yet be secured. In comparison with that object nothing else
mattered. The Turkish weight, therefore, was to be thrown upon
the central front.</p>

<p>But this much being decided, there remained the question how,
exactly, the blow was to be struck. Was the British force in
Mesopotamia to be destroyed as a preliminary to a further advance
into Persia, or were the two operations to be attempted at the same
time, or could the British in Mesopotamia be left alone for the
moment and an advance into Persia, into their rear, be made without
attacking them directly? From the great city of Baghdad, the
capital of Turkish Arabia, and the immediate base for operations on
the central front, it was possible to avoid the Mesopotamian route,
and to strike at Persia by a more northerly line. Which of the
three schemes was the best to adopt? The question seems to have
been considered in detail.</p>

<p>Eventually it was decided that the third was the most promising.
The argument which prevailed with the Turks or their German
advisers seems to have been that the British army in Mesopotamia,
though lately worsted in its onslaught on prepared positions, was
a formidable enemy to attack in the field, and one moreover who
was being reinforced from England and India. Such an attack
would be a very serious and at best a lengthy operation. It would
be better to avoid a direct attack, to make such threats and demonstrations
in Mesopotamia as would suffice to keep the British in
apprehension of a Turkish offensive, and to leave them facing the
positions from which they had suffered so many repulses at the
beginning of the year. They would probably be careful about
assaulting those positions again, and if in the meantime a Turkish
force were to invade Persia, they would probably have to expend
their strength in meeting it there. A considerable number of troops
was therefore prepared for an advance on the Persian frontier by
northerly routes, while the Turks in Mesopotamia were reinforced
to such an extent only as seemed sufficient for the maintenance of
their main positions on the Tigris, and for threatening demonstrations
on the Euphrates.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span></p>

<p>It must be admitted that this reasoning was strategically not
unsound, and that against a timid or over-cautious commander it
might well have succeeded. Happily for Great Britain, the new
British leader, General Maude, was a man who combined reasonable
caution with the knowledge that war cannot be successfully waged
without incurring some risks; and happily also, the summer months
when active warfare was impossible had been utilised by the British
War Office to reinforce and equip his army with such vigour and
thoroughness that it had become a much more formidable weapon
than the Turks imagined. Not only had additional troops been
poured into Mesopotamia from France and elsewhere, until the
numerical superiority had passed to the British, but in other respects
the force had been completely reorganised. By the end of
the summer light railways had been pushed forward, river steamers
in great numbers had been collected from various parts of the
world, stores of food and supplies of all kinds had been sent up
the Tigris and Euphrates, the ports and the rivers themselves had
been vastly developed for traffic. By the end of October General
Maude had been able to move his headquarters from the base at
Basra to the neighbourhood of the Turkish positions, in the knowledge
that the difficulties of transport had been overcome, and that
he had now under his hand a force of troops superior in numbers
to his enemy, and sure for the future of food and all necessary
supplies. It had been a great effort, and his own exertions had
been incessant, but the worst was over. In a few weeks more,
when the weather became fit for campaigning, he would be able
to go forward with every hope of success. Early in December,
when he brought together his Cavalry Division on the Tigris, the
time had almost come.</p>

<p>What General Maude had then to consider, and had doubtless
considered very carefully during the three months which had
elapsed since he took over command in Mesopotamia, was his own
plan of campaign. He knew that the country looked to him to
retake Kut and re-establish the reputation of British arms in Asia,
which the surrender of a British Division, and the bloody repulses
we had suffered in trying to relieve it, had undoubtedly tarnished.
That meant a renewed attack upon the Turks in their strong positions
on the Tigris, which the army under his command was eager
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
to undertake. And he now knew, or believed he knew, that the
enemy intended to advance into Persia in his rear, where the British
forces were small and the Russians not much stronger, while the
Persians themselves were in very doubtful mood. He could hope
for little co-operation on the part of the Russians, either there or on
the side of the Caucasus, for Russia was in serious difficulties; nor
could he hope for any help from the British forces in Egypt. They
apparently had enough on their hands, and in any case they were
separated from him by the Arabian desert. On both flanks of their
great Asiatic battle-front the Turks were practically safe. For
success against them he must depend solely upon the forces under
his own command in the centre of Asia. And since the Allies in
Europe were barely holding their own, he must have felt as Jervis
felt when he sighted the Spanish fleet off St Vincent, that England
had great need of a victory at that moment.</p>

<p>It is evident from what General Maude has left on record that
he had from the first contemplated the action he eventually took.
On this point it is well to let him speak for himself.</p>

<p><i>Despatch of April 10, 1917.</i>&mdash;“Briefly put,” he says, “the
enemy’s plan appeared to be to contain our main forces on the
Tigris, whilst a vigorous campaign, which would directly threaten
India, was being developed in Persia. There were indications,
too, of an impending move down the Euphrates towards Nasariyeh.
To disseminate our troops in order to safeguard the various conflicting
interests involved would have relegated us to a passive
defensive everywhere, and it seemed clear from the outset that the
true solution of the problem was a resolute offensive, with concentrated
forces, on the Tigris, thus effectively threatening Baghdad,
the centre from which the enemy’s columns were operating. Such
a stroke pursued with energy and success would, it was felt,
automatically relieve the pressure in Persia and on the Euphrates,
and preserve quiet in all districts with the security of which we
were charged.</p>

<p>“This, then, was the principle which guided the subsequent
operations, which may be conveniently grouped into phases as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“<i>First.</i>&mdash;Preliminary preparations from 28th August to
12th December.”-</p>

<p>It would be confusing to follow up at this point General
Maude’s summary of his operations, but enough of it has been
given to show that from the time he took command he contemplated
a “resolute offensive” on the Tigris, threatening
Baghdad, and that his preliminary preparations for that movement
were steadily pushed on until the 12th December, when all was ready.</p>

<p>The Turks were astride the river. On the north or left bank
they held the same positions as they had occupied since the fall of
Kut. At Sannaiyat the enemy awaited attack in the same formidable
labyrinth of trenches, flanked by marsh and river, from which in
the early part of the year he had three times repelled the desperate
onslaught of our troops. “Since then he had strengthened and
elaborated this trench system, and a series of successive positions
extended back as far as Kut, fifteen miles in the rear. The river
bank from Sannaiyat to Kut was also intrenched.” On the south
or right bank of the river the enemy was not so far forward. He
had, on this side, withdrawn to a line of intrenched defences which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
curved from a point on the Tigris, only about three miles east of
Kut, to a point on the Hai stream, and thence round again to the
Tigris west of Kut. The Hai stream was also held for some
miles southward with posts and mounted Arab auxiliaries.</p>

<p>The British troops held the north bank of the Tigris up to the
Turkish trenches at Sannaiyat, and the south bank for about
eleven miles farther up-stream. Thus, as General Maude points
out, the British were strategically better situated than the enemy,
for while their flanks were secure the withdrawal of the enemy’s
troops on the south bank seemed to offer a chance for a blow
sooner or later at his communications on the north bank,
which would mean the retreat or capture of the force at
Sannaiyat.</p>

<p>In these circumstances it was decided that the proper course
was, first, to secure possession of the Hai stream, then to clear the
enemy’s trench systems on the right bank of the Tigris, and
finally to cross the Tigris as far west as possible. This idea of
a turning movement by the south was not a new one, for during
the British operations for the relief of Kut more than one attempt
had been made to seize the Hai; but the British forces had been
too weak, and the attempts had failed. Now, as shown above,
General Maude’s army was better fitted in numbers and equipment
to make the attempt with success.</p>

<p>It may be as well to note here what was the composition of
the army. Speaking generally, it may be said that about two-thirds
of it consisted of Indians, drawn from various races, the
remaining third being British. The Indians were not regarded
in Europe, or by the Turks, as equal to the British, nor
were they&mdash;for European warfare at all events. Nevertheless,
they had faced the Turks well in previous fighting, and as shown
in an earlier chapter, they had won some credit even on the
European Front, under great disadvantages. They were, in fact,
excellent soldiers, and the Cavalry had a special reputation. The
British troops were as good as possible, largely drawn from the
old Regular Army, with additions from “Kitchener’s men.” They
were all in high spirits, and eager to get at the enemy. This
was certainly the case in the Thirteenth Hussars, where the men
were very keen to go forward.</p>

<p>On the 12th December the final orders were given. Lieut.-General
Cobbe, with a strong force of Infantry and Artillery, was
to hold the enemy to his positions on the north bank of the
Tigris, and picket the south bank nearly up to the Turkish
positions on that side, while the Cavalry and a force under
Lieut.-General Marshall were by a surprise march to secure and
intrench a position on the Hai. Everything was to be got ready
that night for the opening of the campaign on the morrow.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is curious to note, by the way, that on the 12th December, the day before the advance, a
detail which seems to have given special satisfaction to the British troops was the permission to
shave the moustache. Private Massey’s diary has the following entry: “On the 12th it came
in the orders from the Regimental Office that we could shave the hair off our top lip if we
wished. Many a time have I heard the men grousing and grumbling because it was against
orders to shave the top lip. A great many took advantage of this order, and Captain Eve
appeared on parade with his moustache shaved off. I fetched a pair of scissors, and after cutting
the hair on my top lip quite short, I shaved it off, and I felt much healthier and cleaner.” So
the Thirteenth, or many of them, went into the Mesopotamian fighting after the manner of their
forefathers in the days of Napoleon&mdash;“bien ras&eacute;s.”

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.<br />

<span class="large">DECEMBER 12, 1916-FEBRUARY 24, 1917&mdash;FIGHTING
ON THE TIGRIS.</span></h2>

<p>During the night of the 12th December the last preparations were
completed. General Marshall concentrated his troops in the forward
area from which he was to march on the Hai stream, and General
Cobbe got ready to bombard the Turkish trenches on the north of
the Tigris, so as to give the impression that the British intended
once more to attack Sannaiyat.</p>

<p>On the 13th the bombardment opened, and the new campaign
had begun. General Maude himself moved his Headquarters some
miles forward, and after dark General Marshall’s force, with the
Cavalry on their left, struck out across country for the Hai.</p>

<p>The night march was carried out without mishap. At 6 <small>A.M.</small> on
the morning of the 14th the column had reached its objective
unobserved; and the enemy, taken by surprise, made no stand in
defence of the stream. It was crossed by General Marshall at Atab,
and by the Cavalry a little farther south at Basrujiyeh. The first
move of the campaign had been a complete success.</p>

<p>The Thirteenth had borne their part in the night march, and
owing to the completeness of the surprise had sustained no casualties.
They got over the stream unopposed, and without any difficulty,
for in their Colonel’s words it was “almost a dry bed,” and after
an hour’s rest for watering and feeding the horses they marched
northwards up the right bank of the stream with the Cavalry
Division, while General Marshall’s Infantry marched up the left
bank, the Turks retiring upon their intrenched position covering
Kut. The force was, according to Private Massey, shelled by the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
gunboat <i>Firefly</i>, which the Turks had taken during Townshend’s
retreat on Kut, but without result.</p>

<p>But if the enemy had permitted thus easily the seizure by the
British of a point on the Hai, they were none the less determined
to cling tenaciously to the several strong positions which they still
held on the south bank of the Tigris, and two months of severe
fighting were yet to take place before they could be dislodged from
the last of these. During that time the main fighting had, of course,
to be done by the Infantry and guns, but the Cavalry was constantly
engaged in covering their flanks, “in reconnaissances, in harassing
the enemy’s communications west of the Hai, and in raids, capturing
stock and grain.” The letters and diaries of the Thirteenth will be
quoted as before to show the work of the mounted arm, and their
share in it.</p>

<p><i>2nd Lieutenant Guy Pedder&mdash;December 19, 1916.</i>&mdash;“We are standing-to
at the moment, all packed up ready to move, securing the first
opportunity I have had of writing since we started scrapping. We
left that camp from where I last wrote<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> on the evening of the 13th,
and marched all night and came under Arab fire about 8.30 next
morning. We marched on and on, but my squadron did not get
any show, as we were on flank guard out of it all. We got to a
very famous spot in this part of the world and we had got the Turks
pushed back a few miles. We got to bed very cold and very empty
about 10 o’clock, the wretched horses having had their saddles on
for 27 hours. Next morning I woke up at 5 and found our transport
had got up and a ripping hot breakfast was ready for us. We had
had practically nothing since midnight the night before. We
marched off again about 8, but did not do much all day (a very long
and tiring one). The Regiment only had a couple of casualties, and
we were shelled a bit. Next day was much the same, getting back
after dark. Then Sunday we were told we were going to have a
day’s rest; however, about 9 o’clock, Pearson and I were sent out
with two troops to report on some mounted troops right away in
the distance. We galloped out and got as close as we dare and
reported about 800 Arabs, and galloped back, the battery having
got our range firing over our heads, to find the whole Regiment
were out, and as D had turned [out] quickest we formed the advance-guard.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
We went about five miles at a tremendous pace but could
not catch them, and then were told to act as rearguard to the
Regiment, which was moving back to camp, and then the fun began.
Directly we turned homewards on came any number of what we
thought were Arabs shooting at us from long range, and making
it very unpleasant; however, we did our job and got back all right
with only three men hit, two slightly; five horses, three killed. We
found out afterwards that we were up against a mixed force of Turks
and Arabs. I thought the firing was too unpleasantly good for Arabs.
Yesterday we went out in force and waited about all day, but never
got a show. Directly we turned homewards we were shelled. The
Regiment was extremely lucky, no one hit. Two shells burst only
a few yards from me and my troop, but no one was hit and the
horses only made a slight fuss for a second or two. My men were
excellent under fire.... This sort of fighting is better than in
France, as though there is not so much cover there is more room
and space, and of course there is not nearly so much shelling. We
could not possibly camp at night so close to the line in France as
we do here. I hear our English mail is on its way from its last
standing camp from where I last wrote, and is being brought up by
camels. I am more than grateful for that waistcoat, especially in the
evening and first thing in the morning, when we get an icy cold
wind. During the day the weather is perfect, just like spring at
home.”</p>

<p><i>Captain W. H. Eve&mdash;December 19.</i>&mdash;“These Arabs and Turkish
Cavalry are wretched brutes to fight. They won’t let you get near
them. Then directly you start home away from them they attack and
worry.... It always seems to be the way. Luckily as a rule they
are apparently pretty bad shots. I am rather hopeless of ever being
able to get at them mounted, but I shall try, and we may get the
Infantry out of their trenches one day. But there’s nothing to worry
about, we are right on top of them. The job is to get near them.”</p>

<p><i>Lieutenant Munster&mdash;December 19.</i>&mdash;“We left our camp a week
ago and have been skirmishing about ever since. So far we have
had only very slight casualties, and it does not appear to me as
though we Cavalry should become heavily engaged. Up to now we
have been occupied in keeping the Arabs from interfering with
operations against the Turks. We are quite comfortable, and on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
full rations. There seems to be no difficulty about supplies. The
weather has not broken yet. Our horses are having a hard time
just now.”</p>

<p>Private Massey writes in his diary regarding these casualties:
“As the bullets which the Arabs use are as big as a man’s little
finger, with flattened nose just rounded off, they make a big noise
going through the air, as well as making terrible wounds.” The
horses suffered most.</p>

<p><i>Lieutenant Chrystall.</i>&mdash;“We have been doing, as you will no
doubt have seen by the papers, a little fighting, and have been
doing a lot of night marching on ‘operation scale,’ which means
waterproof sheet, one blanket, and biscuits and bully, and out all
day. Our horses at times have been forty-four hours without water,
which of course is very hard. Well, we were bemoaning our fate
when we were ordered out on Christmas Eve morning for an all-night
show, and thinking we will never have any Christmas dinner
at all. We returned to camp about 3 <small>P.M.</small> on Christmas Day and
found a much-belated Christmas parcel awaiting us, and all your
splendid parcels. We had a meal fit for a king, and we had to
thank all you good people for it.”</p>

<p><i>Captain W. H. Eve&mdash;December 27.</i>&mdash;“Personally I see no show
ever for us, and am sorry I ever joined the Cavalry.... I have
no delusions about it now.... I shall never get a gallop with my
squadron....”</p>

<p><i>2nd Lieutenant Guy Pedder&mdash;December 30.</i>&mdash;“We are back again
in the same camp as we started out from for this show,<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> and got
back just in time, as it has rained almost ever since. We are pretty
comfortable in our tents, after much digging. I mean, we dig out
the inside of our tents, and make a trench all round to keep the
water out. You achieve three things by doing this: (1) your tent
is much warmer; (2) you have much more room and do not
bump your head every time you turn round; (3) you keep dry....
We can’t possibly move up again for another show until the sun
comes out and dries the mud, which is ankle-deep now. (Thank
goodness! I was able to buy a pair of gum-boots from our Ordnance
here.) Ormrod, Hill, and Lord arrived with a draft. They marched
up-country and brought us some horses which we wanted badly.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
One night the Arabs scored over them well. Ormrod had his gun
stolen out of his tent, Hill and Lord had all their kit taken, including
bedding, valises, &amp;c., and the sentries were on duty all round
and within a few yards of the spot! The Arab is a marvellous
thief.... The actual Christmas parcels have not arrived yet; all
the same, we had a wonderful Christmas dinner only about three
miles from Kut&mdash;soup, fish, mutton, and vegetables (we got the
mutton after raiding an Arab Fort on Christmas Eve), champagne,
two bottles for six of us (gift from Lord Curzon, I believe), an
enormous plum-pudding which I bought at the E.F.C.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> before we left
here, also there was a Christmas cake and pudding given by telegraph.
There is an E.F.C. up here now, but owing to transport difficulties
it runs out of everything you want very quickly; but the best thing
of all is our regimental coffee-shop (the only one in Mesopotamia,
I believe). Even right up here it is open again, and you can buy
anything from getting soda-water bottles refilled to buying assorted
chocolates.... A tremendous thunderstorm is raging as I write,
and it is coming down in buckets; to-morrow the mud will be
knee-deep.”</p>

<p><i>2nd Lieutenant J. O. P. Clarkson&mdash;December 30.</i>&mdash;“Here’s a good
story and true. One of our monitors had been up to an advanced
position to shell the Turks, but had got heavily shelled itself. After
a few days of this they tried to pull the Turks’ leg a bit. They
rigged a <i>mahailla</i> (Arab boat) with funnels and mast to represent
a monitor, towed it up during the night, and the next day put it
into position, burning oily rags and brown paper to represent its
being under steam. It was not shelled. They towed it up higher
still. It was not shelled. The next day a notice appeared from
the Turkish trenches, and it ran, “Your real monitors amuse us,
but your dummy one is superb.”</p>

<p><i>Lieutenant Munster&mdash;December 30.</i>&mdash;“Still here and still raining.
There can hardly be any doubt that we shall not be moved at
present, the mud is so awful. I used to think the mud at Aldershot
could not be surpassed, but now I am inclined to think Mesopotamia
beats it. We have to build little mud walls round our tents to
keep the water out. I did not build mine deep enough, and as a
result I think I had a foot and a half of water in my tent. It came
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
just two or three inches short of the level of my bed. I woke up
and saw my boots and clothes floating about.”</p>

<p><i>January 4, 1917.</i>&mdash;“We have been in our permanent camp about
ten days now, and are quite likely to be here all the winter. After
the winter come the floods, and before the floods have gone down
the great heat comes on, so that October, November, and December
are considered to be the only fighting months of the year. This
year active operations did not start until December 14th, and the
Cavalry withdrew to permanent billets on December 26th.”</p>

<p><i>Captain W. H. Eve&mdash;January 17.</i>&mdash;“I got your letter of December
3rd when we got back here to standing camp the day before
yesterday. We are still all whole and flourishing, and I am very
fit indeed. We left the base November 3rd.... The ‘show’
was to start on the 14th,<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> and we marched from here on the evening
of the 13th. From the papers you will probably have gathered
more or less what we did to start with.</p>

<p>“We were on the left or outer flank of the Infantry attack,
away on the south. Marched all night, crossed the river Hai
(nearly dry then) at dawn on the 14th; meeting with no opposition,
then turned north up its western bank, and kept pace with the
Infantry attack.</p>

<p>“Our part of the show was a success, a complete surprise to
the enemy apparently, and in fact we didn’t run into any of them
for some time. We had a little sniping from Arabs and a few Turk
Cavalry, but no real fighting. We had a longish trek though,
about twenty-six hours for our horses under saddle, as we did not
get back to doss down by the river until about 9 <small>P.M.</small>, 14th.</p>

<p>“The next two days we spent in reconnaissance wide on the
flank, had long days for the horses, no water from morning till
night (luckily cool weather), but we had no fighting, only got shelled
once or twice.”</p>

<p><i>Sunday.</i>&mdash;“I had a little scrap with the squadron. We got a
sight of about 800 Arabs and Turks, and the Regiment, which was
for duty that day, turned out after them. We could not catch
them, but on going home had a rearguard fight, which devolved on
my squadron, and wherein they pleased me.</p>

<p>“This rearguard business, the worst and most unsatisfactory to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
do, is the Arabs’ great game. We had two or three more days’
reconnaissance. We accomplished nothing, and then were sent on
a show to try and bridge the river Tigris higher up. This was a
failure, and we rather got it in the neck, so you won’t see anything
of it in the papers. The Regiment that day was in reserve, so I
saw very little of it, but of course I know what happened.</p>

<p>“On Christmas Eve we went off to deal with a hostile Arab
chief down south. That meant another night march, and so on.
But we found the bird had flown, and had to content ourselves with
sacking his fort and village, and collecting what cattle and sheep
we could.</p>

<p>“We got back here on Boxing Day, and it then rained for a
week or more, and we lived in mud. But here, of course, we are
in permanent camp and under canvas. I must say that so far we
have been more than lucky with our weather when out.</p>

<p>“On the 7th we left here again, only got back on the 15th,
during which time we were trekking about again, chasing after Arabs,
and eventually were chased by them, as usual, on our way home.
I had really no fighting.... I have told you all this about ourselves,
though it is not in the least important, just to show you the sort
of life we lead.”</p>

<p>During this week the Regiment marched down to “Hai Town,”
a considerable place on the Hai stream, and collected some supplies
and Arab arms. Private Massey gives a sad account of the soldiers’
disappointment at the loss of a good meal in a deserted village.</p>

<p>“Here we seized several fowls and killed a few calves, taking
only their livers, kidneys, and hearts, which we carried in our water-buckets.
We camped close to the village for the night. After
unsaddling our horses and watering and feeding were over, we lit
a fire and commenced to cook the spoils of victory. But alas! when
the water was nearly boiling for tea, and the livers and kidneys
were frizzling in the mess-tins over a hot fire, the order was given,
‘Fall in for line picket!’ Of course that was enough to test the
temper and patience of a parson, let alone a soldier, and a steady
stream of expletives could be heard as we sloped arms and marched
away. That night I had biscuits and bully, a poor substitute for
fried liver and kidneys.”</p>

<p>It was hard, but Private Massey and his “messing-in chum,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
M‘Nulty, had better luck a few days later at another village, and
the diary triumphantly records how, “During the night M‘Nulty
managed to get several livers, kidneys, and hearts from the
slaughtering place, and we had fried liver and kidneys served up
hot before r&eacute;veill&eacute; next morning, as well as a mess-tin full of hot
cocoa, made from tablets I had sent from England.”</p>

<p><i>Private Hugh H. Mortimer&mdash;January 18.</i>&mdash;“Round about the back
of beyond. Yours of the 5th ulto. duly to hand about five or six
days ago. I say about, because one has no idea as to days and
dates, &amp;c., out here, Sundays included. Sometimes we get a
volunteer Church parade when things are quiet, but that has been
very seldom of late. The last one we had, last Sunday but one, I
volunteered for one the night before, but what ho! the parade was
for 11 <small>A.M.</small>, and we had been on the trek reconnoitring and Arab-chasing
five hours by then. We are quite seasoned hands at these
quick turn-outs now; often we’re all bivouacked down, giving it the
bells in Snore Land, unless it happens to be your turn for guard,
then somebody strolls round in a quiet hurry, kicks the sergeant in
the ribs, and whispers, ‘Turn out at once; parade two hundred yards
west of camp midnight.’ The kicks, &amp;c., are passed on, and we
are all saddled up, transport packed, &amp;c., &amp;c., and perhaps three or
four miles away in less than an hour, and all that done in the
dark, and no noise above a whisper, unless somebody gets a kick
in the seat from a bobbery horse, and then there is some excuse
for letting it rip.</p>

<p>“Yes, one day is much of a muchness with the next, unless it
is that one has no time to think about what day it happens to be.
Often I have asked five or six chaps the date to put in a letter,
and then had to consult the orderly sergeant at the finish. Still,
I don’t suppose it would make any difference to one’s destination
if one happened to snuff it on a Friday or Sunday. We get in bags
of warm spots now ever since we came right up, about two months
ago. Sort of places that make the short hairs stand out on the
back of the neck, and wonder if the next 12-pounder or so on has
your number on it. I thought I knew a bit of what it feels to sit
in a trench with them coming over in France, but galloping about
in open country with shrapnel flying about licks it hollow. I saw
one drop in a machine-gun section about fifteen yards on my right

some fortnight ago, and that one bagged four men and three horses,
and then several pieces hummed past me.... Then again the cod
was galloping across a hail-storm for a mile from cover to cover.
I took the Hotchkiss gun across&mdash;I am a nob at Hotchkiss guns
now&mdash;and the remainder of the section followed some thirty yards
behind at the canter. We got five shrapnel quick, and not more
than thirty or forty yards away, and two of them in front of me and
one behind the two parties. I looked round after the thud, having a
good horse, and you talk about dust-flying&mdash;well, I thought ‘There’s
only me in this section now,’ and made a lightning spurt for a
deep donga, dropped into it with a crash, and pulled up. About six
seconds afterwards two more crashes, and there appeared the rest of
the team, a bit pale and smiling rather sickly smiles, but not a
scratch on either men or horses, so you may judge of the luck of
the mob. The worst of this country is, you can’t depend on the
district for any supplies like you can in France; after we’ve had
nothing but a couple of biscuits and one 12-oz. tin of bully from
day to day for several days, when we get out of touch with the
ration stands, that just seems to be the time when one could
do with about four good sit-down knife-and-fork square meals per
diem. When it’s like that I go up two extra holes in my belt and
try not to think of steak and chips or anything in that line. Never
mind, I will make it all up when and if I get home. Roll on that
time too. Have just received a letter from Fannie, and she says
people at home say, ‘Oh, he’s safe in Mesopotoom,’ but by the H.P.
I never felt unsafer in France, Somme or no Somme. You may think
that it’s generally understood that the last round is for yourself,
before being taken alive by Arabs, although the Turks seem to fight
very fair, and there are no tanks to walk behind and no trenches to
bob down in.”</p>

<p><i>Lieutenant Chrystall&mdash;January 20.</i>&mdash;“To-day we were within one
and a half miles of Kut. ‘So near and yet so far,’ and we hear
to-day some trenches have been taken, so things are looking up a
bit. To-day we got a splendid ration of beef, a sirloin, probably
the first one ever seen in Mesopotamia.... One has to be
very drastic with these people, the women being just as bad as
the men. If you do not take strong steps they will shoot you
in the back, even if they have shown the white flag, which they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
usually do when we are advancing, but when retiring they shoot
at you.”</p>

<p><i>Captain Eve&mdash;January 20.</i>&mdash;“When we approached our objective,
the big native town [Hai Town], they came out with a white flag
and pretended to be friendly, and we treated them as such, and
<i>bought</i> supplies and things from them, and of course they made a
fortune out of us.... Then Sunday, the 14th, we started back.
As soon as we had left, our rearguard was heavily attacked (native
regiments), and we had some casualties, and were very much delayed,
and the Regiment sent to their support, but had very little
to do.”</p>

<p><i>January 26.</i>&mdash;“I wish I could tell you <i>really</i> all about things out
here, but it is quite impossible. Only I do wish now above all else
that I could have gone to Infantry or gunners. I have slowly but
surely come to the conviction that we are years out of date, and
entirely or almost entirely useless, and will never take a real part
again.”</p>

<p><i>2nd Lieutenant J. O. P. Clarkson&mdash;February 2.</i>&mdash;“Since my last
letter we have done quite a bit. First we tried to go round the
Pushtikuh Mountains,<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> so early one morning we started off in order
to cross the bridge. It took us over two hours to get across, and
then we were the leading unit of the 2nd Brigade. We went past
a fort to the Wadi river for water, and then pushed on to try and
cross the marsh. But we got hopelessly bogged, at least the guns
and the transport did, although they had double teams in as it
was. Meanwhile we were all anxiously looking at the sky, as there
was a devil of a storm coming up. So those people who had
crossed the marsh had to recross it again. We camped down just
off the marsh, and had scarcely got the lines down when it started
to pour with rain. We crawled into our valises (no tents), and
slept, and woke up soaking, boots full of water and thoroughly wet.
It was still raining. We got up at 5 <small>A.M.</small>, and had to wait until
they had got all the waggons out of the marsh, some having been
left there the evening before. We waited about five hours. Luckily
it then turned out fine, and we started back. Our things were
more or less dry by the time we got into our camp by the fort
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
about twelve or sixteen miles from the Arab village. We got back
to our permanent camp about 2 <small>P.M.</small> next day. The going after
that rain was very heavy, and both men and horses came in very
tired. We had a very short rest and now are out again.”</p>

<p>The Regiment had returned on the 27th January to the Hai
river, and from there during the following week made several reconnaissances
to the westward, beyond Kut, where the Turks had
a bridge across the Tigris, and some strong intrenched positions
on the south bank. They had been dislodged from some points
lower down, but still held on desperately to the westerly bends of
the river in order to protect from attack the line of communications
of their main force in Sannaiyat. Until the 4th February the
Thirteenth, though at times under heavy fire from rifles and machine-guns
and artillery, got off practically without loss. Then there
was a sharp fight, in which the Cavalry was called upon to act
dismounted in conjunction with the Infantry, and the Thirteenth
had some casualties. An officer was killed and two wounded, with
a few non-commissioned officers and men.</p>

<p>The officer killed, Lieutenant Munster, was much respected in
the Regiment, “a very gallant, zealous, and capable officer,” as his
Colonel reported. All accounts agree in describing him as a man
of exceptional character, who, though young, had already made his
mark. Quiet and reserved, with strong religious views, he was
spoken of in unusual language by many of those about him. “I
am not good at expressing myself,” one of them wrote, “but I
may say his daily life was one which I shall try to follow: it was
one of doing good to his fellow-men; my admiration for him was
unbounded, and my grief worse and more intense than I ever felt
in my life.” His death seems to have been due to his unselfish
devotion, for having led his men forward and seen all of them under
cover preparing for another rush, he walked across the open to
avoid exposing one of them in sending a message to another officer,
and was shot through the heart. Such was the fire at the moment
that his Colonel said: “I judged it inexpedient to attempt to recover
his body, and to remove a brother officer, Mr Williams Taylor,
and some men who were wounded, until after dark.”</p>

<p>Nor were they the only two to distinguish themselves on this
day. Captain Robinson, commanding “B” Squadron, had been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
wounded in leading the advance shortly before, and Sergeant Tassie
of “D” Squadron received the D.C.M. for his coolness and courage
in bringing up ammunition when the transport animals were shot
down.</p>

<p>Other officers of the Regiment also showed great courage on
this day, and it is a temptation to record what was afterwards
written of them by an eye-witness&mdash;a Captain in one of the Indian
regiments of the Brigade.</p>

<p>“Our Brigade was ordered to attack dismounted, Hussars on
the left, ourselves in the centre, with Watson’s Horse echeloned
to the right rear. This meant that the Hussars had to advance
across the open with no cover, whilst we had the cover afforded by
the high banks of the nullah. After an advance of about 1400
yards the fire became so heavy that the Hussars decided to left-shoulder
and make for the nullah, with the object of working down
it and thus coming to assaulting distance. Their casualties had
been pretty heavy. They eventually made the nullah in advance
of our line, and cleared out some advanced patrols of Turks who
were holding it there.</p>

<p>“Captain Willis and I were now sent down by my C.O. to gain
touch with the Hussars by working down the nullah.</p>

<p>“I met Captain Newton and asked him who was commanding.
He said he was for the moment, because Captain Eve and Captain
Steele were outside, and he was reorganising the men preparatory
to making a further advance.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> Just as he spoke a renewed burst
of machine-gun and rifle fire made me look over the top to see what
was happening. I saw Eve and Steele helping in a wounded man
who had been hit in the leg. The man had an arm round each of
their necks. The Turks furiously opened up at them, and I don’t
know how they got away, for the ground all round was being
thrown up by bullets.</p>

<p>“I don’t think Eve realised he was doing anything exceptional,
his only concern seemed to be getting the man in without giving
him pain. What struck me most was the cool way he handed the
man in, carefully caught up the thong of his crop, which he always
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
carried, and then jumped down into the nullah under a perfect
hail of machine-gun bullets. He turned to me as if nothing in the
world had happened, and we discussed the situation.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></p>

<p>“A few minutes later I went back and brought my squadron
forward.</p>

<p>“By this time the C.O. of the Hussars and my own C.O. had
arrived, and we all went down the nullah together.</p>

<p>“When we were talking to Eve, a man came up and said that
a private of the Hussars was lying about forty yards outside the
nullah and shouting for help. My C.O. turned to me and said,
‘See if you can get him in,’ but Eve said, ‘Nonsense, he is a man
in my squadron.’ So he and Captain Jeffrey immediately left the
cover and finally found the man. The man had only had his arm
shattered, so after Eve had spoken to him he got up and they all
came in safely....</p>

<p>“Eve realised that it was impossible to leave these wounded
men until dark, because we anticipated a counter-attack about
dusk, and it was necessary to be hampered as little as possible
then.... Also the presence of numerous Arab irregulars made
the possibility of leaving our wounded out of the question....</p>

<p>“It was one of the most gallant things I have ever seen, and
was just typical of Eve. I know he did not give it another
thought, and only considered he had done his duty, but that too
is only typical of the man.”</p>

<p>Captain Eve’s own comment upon the day was short:&mdash;</p>

<p>“It went very well,” he writes, “but we weren’t allowed to
hold on to what we had got, which rather took the gilt off the
gingerbread. We had bad luck in officers, as you will have seen,
Bob [Captain Robinson] and Williams Taylor being both hit, and
poor Munster being killed. But the casualties among the men
were very light, and in fact we were very lucky.</p>

<p>“This was undoubtedly from our own point of view the most
satisfactory day we have had, though it was only a side-show.”</p>

<p>A letter of the 6th February gives a more detailed account.</p>

<p><i>Captain Eve&mdash;February 6.</i>&mdash;“We came under pretty hot rifle
and Maxim-gun fire, but not shell-fire. They shelled the guns and
the horses in rear but not us. Well, the men are something to be
proud of. They just advanced as they should. It was really just
like a day on the sand-hills at Meerut. We had very few casualties
in our advance, that is among the men, and the Turks did not
wait for us in their advanced position, nor again in their first line,
which was a big and deep dry canal. We got it fairly hot from
enfilade Maxim-gun fire just before we got to this, but we got
there all right.... All this time I had been with ‘C’ and ‘D’,
the others on my left and behind. Then after we had got settled
in our trench ‘B’ came in, and at last ‘A’, and I found I was commanding
the lot. I also found poor old ‘B’ had dropped into it
badly, Bob shot through the leg (slight), Williams Taylor badly
in the thigh, and Munster killed. Barrett was therefore commanding,
and only Hill left with them. The rest were all right,
though Williams of ‘A’ had a bullet through his hat which made
a furrow along the back of his head. I then found our flanks were
in the air as neither of the other Regiments was up; but the
Turks made no attempt to counter-attack, and we were pretty
safe, except that one of their Maxim guns kept firing down the
trench. So I couldn’t go any farther without support, and
reported by signal. Presently one of the others came up on our
right, and our guns got very busy. Then the only bad thing that
I saw happened. They tried to send our ammunition pack-horses
up to us across the open. They got to within about 200 yards,
and then got properly caught by Maxim-gun fire. The men got
hit and the horses loose, and then the poor beasts stood, just
being shot to death, one going after another. Sergeant Tassie on
his own, and I think young Stirling did too, ran out to them
across the open, and succeeded in getting one in, and he then
went back and brought in ammunition off a horse that had been
killed. It was a very fine thing, and I have pushed in his name
for a D.C.M....</p>

<p>“The Colonel was delighted with the Regiment, and so was the
Brigade.... The men were very pleased with themselves, and I
with them. They were just first-class.... Poor old Munster
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
was shot right through the chest and killed instantly. He was
such a nice man&mdash;very shy and reserved, but a real good sort,
and every one is so sorry.</p>

<p>“My best bit of news of all is that Tassie has got the D.C.M.
I know how pleased you will be.... He wears the ribbon, but I
hope will have it presented in public some time. I am pleased
and proud about it.</p>

<p>“Williams had another bullet clean through his helmet on
Friday. He was trying to snipe a sniper, and was successful too&mdash;killed
his man.”</p>

<p><i>February 16.</i>&mdash;“Yesterday, Thursday, we started at 5, breakfast
at 4 <small>A.M.</small>&mdash;out to the same ground on the left flank. We
kept the horses well back, and I was left in charge of
them, and had a desperately dull day. However, I missed
nothing, as the Division had very little to do except for the
gunners. But it was a real good day&mdash;the Infantry did well, in
fact it was quite a little victory. We completely cleared the
south bank&mdash;took 1500 prisoners, including fifty officers, two
battalion commanders among them, and killed a great number,
including most of those trying to get back across the river, as we
sank the whole of their pontoons and coracles while crossing.
Also we got three of their aeroplanes. It was a good show
altogether, and finishes this stage of the operations. The next, as
you can see, must be to force the passage of the river and clear
them out of Kut on the north.</p>

<p>“This will mean heavy fighting.”</p>

<p>Private Massey, after describing how the enemy tried to get
across “in pontoon boats and oracles,” says: “They looked a
dejected lot indeed, clothed in rags, no boots, and they had had
very little food for some time. They eagerly took cigarettes offered
them, and went limping off to the river dock for removal to the
prisoners’ camp, resembling as they went a tribe of lame and
ragged beggars. But the Turk has a stout heart, is as brave as a
lion, and will fight like the very devil on a handful of dates and a
morsel of flour.”</p>

<p>Pity that with all his fine qualities, which appeal so strongly to
the British soldier, he has not yet learnt to treat his prisoners
without brutality.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span></p>

<p><i>Captain Eve&mdash;February 16.</i>&mdash;“I don’t suppose we shall be wanted
until we have the crossing secure, but after that we may have some
fun.... We, of course, have had nothing to do with it really, but
then we are only Cavalry.”</p>

<p><i>February 19.</i>&mdash;“We were in camp two days afterwards (after
the action on the 4th), then were out on a foraging expedition on
the 7th. On the 9th we were out on reconnaissance again all day
and half the night, then had two or three days very bad weather,
and on the 14th and 15th had two very long days and nights.</p>

<p>“But the last one was the final successful show which cleared
out the Turks from this southern bank altogether. It was quite
a good show, but we were sitting out wide on the flank all the
time, and had really very little to do with it, and could see nothing.
Still, it is quite good, and one feels something is accomplished at
last. Now we have far the hardest part in front of us, but we
shall do the job all right before long.</p>

<p>“Since the 15th we have been left in peace, and very glad of it
we were. The horses begin to look a little better already.</p>

<p>“I have told you all this just to give you an idea how we are
worked. Most days we are fifteen to twenty hours under saddle,
and short and irregular water, besides long distances, and much
night work, worst of all. Our unfortunate horses began to look
like shadows, but are recovering a little now, and we have had
one batch of very nice remounts, though we are still about one
hundred short.</p>

<p>“All the men are very fit indeed, and so are we. It is desperately
cold at times, but we are managing by degrees to get our
tents out from the permanent camp.</p>

<p>“My squadron, of which I am now again in command, Twist
having rejoined for duty, has sunk from six of us to four, as
Pearson has left us to join probably the Australians, and Pardon
is laid by with a badly sprained ankle.</p>

<p>“I expect we shall be busy again in a few days. We have
been extraordinarily lucky in the weather, take it all round, and
I should think Maude will take advantage of it while it lasts.
Let’s hope so.”</p>

<p><i>February 21.</i>&mdash;“I am starting my chat to-day because we are
going out to-morrow, so I make certain of catching the mail. We
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
shall have had a six days’ easy&mdash;haven’t been out since Thursday,
the 15th, and it has been very nice. To-morrow I fancy the next
stage of the proceedings is to start, probably crossing to the north.
I don’t imagine we shall have anything to do but sit on the flank
at first, and until the Infantry as usual have done the work....</p>

<p>“I started to write to mother after my chat to you last Friday
evening, and then a most terrific thunderstorm with heavy hail
and a gale of wind suddenly came on, and we had to turn out and
stand to the horses, only just in time to stop a stampede. In
fact, for a minute or two after we were with them, I thought they
might go. I got to mine, Follow Me and Caprice tangled up
together. We held them all right, but it was pretty miserable&mdash;pitch
dark, blowing a hurricane, and hail you couldn’t face. The
men were top hole. When the storm passed, we got the lines
down again (in water) and made all secure. We were, of course,
wet through, and I then found our tent flooded out, beds in an
inch of water, &amp;c.... It blew and rained hard in the night, and
the poor wretched men were wet through and in the open, all
flooded or mud. Box and I kept dry in our tent, and it held all
right against the wind....</p>

<p>“The men, as a matter of fact, have got into the way of making
themselves the most cosy little dug-outs. They dig down and
cover up with their waterproof sheets. They are wonders&mdash;never
have any of them sick&mdash;two rubbed heels is my total sick in the
squadron, and yet in permanent camp there would probably be
a sick-list of ten....</p>

<p>“The river has risen tremendously the last few days, and is
only a few feet from the top. Let’s hope it does not rise any
more or we shall be completely flooded out.... I have got
thirteen extra men out from permanent camp, and with the new
horses can turn out something like a respectable squadron....
I am still short of horses, could do with any amount more like
the last lot. Do you remember how in peace time it was always
too many horses and no men? And now it is the exact opposite,
just when horses are wanted.”<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></p>

<small>(DIED AT SEA ON THE WAY HOME IN APRIL 1919)</small></p></div>

<p><i>February 23.</i>&mdash;“Well, we didn’t go out on Thursday, yesterday,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
the whole show being postponed owing to the river having risen
too much. It has since fallen, and the show started early this
morning, and so far is going very well indeed, and we are standing-to
in readiness.</p>

<p>“Besides this show, we have taken a great part of the first and
second lines of the Sannaiyat position and repulsed five or six
counter-attacks, so all is very well....</p>

<p>“Payne overheard the following between two of the men the
other day. ‘That there Major Fry, ’e’s been made a Colonel.’
‘What, ’im? <i>What’s</i> wrong with him?’ I think it good enough
for ‘Punch’ if only one could draw a picture for it....”</p>

<p>General Maude had certainly been lucky in the weather, the
winter floods not having yet made the river impassable, and he
was taking full advantage of his chances. The “quite good show”
of the 15th had been the last of a series of carefully-planned and
hard-fought Infantry attacks, which had gradually torn away the
Turkish hold from point after point upon the south bank of the
Tigris. The enemy was now thrown across the river, and in
desperate anxiety for his long line of communications. They
were still covered by a swollen river more than three hundred
yards broad, but they were not safe from a resolute attack, and
after some skilful feinting here and there the blow was about to be
driven home.</p>

<p>Maude was not the man to lose an hour. On the 23rd of February,
just before daybreak, some Infantry, English and Goorkha,
were ferried across the Tigris at the Shamran bend, west of Kut,
and after hard fighting succeeded in establishing themselves on the
northern bank. Before dark the same afternoon a bridge had been
completed. The end of the long suspense had come. The Turks
had fought stubbornly for more than two months, but their line of
communications had now been struck, and their main force must
go or be captured.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.<br />

<span class="large">THE RECAPTURE OF KUT&mdash;RETREAT OF THE TURKS.</span></h2>

<p>At the same time that the Tigris was being crossed westward of
Kut, the Turkish intrenchments at Sannaiyat were fiercely attacked
in front, and the brave defenders, learning that the river defence
had fallen behind them, at last gave way. On the 24th the maze
of trenches which had resisted so many onslaughts was carried
with a rush, and sweeping on rapidly the British troops replaced
the British flag on the walls of Kut. On the same morning the
British Cavalry poured across the bridge from the southern bank
in pursuit of the retreating enemy, and the British gunboats pressed
up the river again to join in his destruction. There was reason to
hope that he had held on too long, and that his stubborn troops
were doomed to be taken or destroyed.</p>

<p>This hope proved to be delusive. The Turks had to retreat very
rapidly to extricate themselves in time, and they lost heavily in
doing so; but they, or the bulk of them, did succeed in getting away.
Many were slain, and some thousands remained in British hands,
but by steady and determined rearguard fighting they checked their
pursuers, and when they reached Azizieh, a hundred miles off, half
way to Baghdad,<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> they were still a military force, if a defeated one.</p>

<p>The share of the Thirteenth in the victory and pursuit was
not all that they hoped it might have been. Some eager spirits
among them chafed at the caution with which the Cavalry was

handled and the pursuit carried on. But nevertheless the mounted
men, although unable to storm entrenchments held by a resolute
enemy, had throughout done much to cover and facilitate the
operations of the Infantry and guns, and they now did all that
mounted men could do to harass the retreat. If it did not
mean converting the retreat into a complete rout, and annihilating
a Turkish army, it was a material contribution towards that end.
After three days of steady pressure, during which the Cavalry lost
a good many men, they had pushed the Turks over a long stretch
of road, capturing prisoners and guns and booty of all kinds; and
if they were stopped there, half-way to Baghdad, it was only because
they had got in advance of their supplies and of the supporting
Infantry.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>THE ADVANCE ON BAGHDAD</i><br />
<small>SCALE ABOUT 25 MILES TO THE INCH</small></p></div>

<p>The following extracts from letters and journals tell the story
in greater detail.</p>

<p><i>Lieut.-Colonel Richardson, D.S.O.</i>&mdash;“On the 24th of February
we left camp about an hour before daylight, reached Shumran,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
where a pontoon had been thrown across the Tigris the previous
day by the Sappers and Infantry, crossed the river about 9 <small>A.M.</small>,
and gradually moved up to behind the Dahra Ridge, which at that
time was the most advanced point held by our infantry. At noon
we found what we thought was an opening in the Turkish line,
went through it, and made a big left-handed sweep, until we were
brought to a standstill by the Turkish rearguard, strongly intrenched.
We were engaged with this till after dark, when we returned to
bivouac, which we reached about 1 <small>A.M.</small> We were in the saddle
again at daybreak on the 25th, and took up the pursuit of the Turks,
who had left their intrenchments. At about midday we located their
rearguard in position about Imam Mahdi, on the north bank of the
Tigris, and the Regiment was ordered to attack dismounted, with
the 14th Lancers on our left. We were closely engaged with the
Turks until about 5 <small>P.M.</small>, when orders were received to withdraw.
Then we found that our casualties had been heavy, but mostly in
wounded, the numbers being approximately one officer, Lieutenant
Lord, and thirty-six men wounded. That night again we reached
our bivouac after midnight, and were again on the move at daylight.</p>

<p>“On this day, 26th February, the Regiment was in reserve and
not engaged. We bivouacked where we stood that night, and at
daybreak took up the pursuit of the Turks, who were now in full
retreat. Before midday we had taken some 300 prisoners, and had
found six field-guns of large calibre, which had been left by the
Turks. After that we replenished our nose-bags from a captured
barge well stocked with barley, and followed the road taken by the
retreating Turks, which was strewn with rifles, bayonets, small-arm
ammunition, trench-mortars, to which the draft cattle were still
harnessed, hundreds of 5.9 shells, carts full of implements, and even
a motor-car. We bivouacked at dark some six miles from Azizieh.”</p>

<p>In General Maude’s despatch giving a summary of these operations
is the following passage:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Our gunboats were in touch with and shelled the retreating
enemy during most of the 27th, and his retirement was harassed by
the Cavalry until after dark, when his troops were streaming through
Azizieh in great confusion.” General Maude adds that since crossing
the Tigris his force had captured 4000 prisoners, of whom 188 were
officers, and great quantities of guns and stores. But now the pursuit,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
in which the Navy and the Cavalry had co-operated in an unusual
way, was broken off. The Turkish army had made good its hasty
retreat, and was for the moment free to get away unmolested.</p>

<p>“We bivouacked at dark,” says Colonel Richardson, “some six
miles from Azizieh, and next day received orders to retire about ten
miles, in order to allow supplies, which we had outrun, and the infantry,
to come up. On our way back we collected all that was possible of
the ammunition and stores that might be useful to us. On the 28th
of February we spent a very welcome rest day in camp. On the
1st of March we marched to Azizieh, where a halt was ordered.”</p>

<p>In fact, the Infantry having fallen behind, or rather, perhaps,
having been kept back by the difficulty of bringing up sufficient
supplies, there was a pause of five days during which the British
force was closed up and got ready for a farther advance. Baghdad
now lay immediately ahead, but as the Turks were not in such a
condition of rout that they could be hunted through the great town
<i>l’&eacute;p&eacute;e aux reins</i>, it was necessary to move with the force thoroughly
together, and not to risk a check.</p>

<p>The following are further extracts from letters and diaries:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Private Massey&mdash;February 24, 1917.</i>&mdash;“On the 24th, r&eacute;veill&eacute; was at 2
<small>A.M.</small>, and we turned out on parade at 4.30 <small>A.M.</small> The previous night
the Engineers had thrown a bridge across at Shamran bend, and
early this morning, the 24th,<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> the Infantry had succeeded in getting
across, and we followed soon after.</p>

<p>“The Turks, seeing their danger, had retreated the previous
night, leaving only a rearguard to delay our advance, and cover the
retreat of their main body.... After crossing the pontoon-bridge
we formed troop, and went along in extended order, until we got
close in on the enemy’s rearguard. Here we dismounted and
brought the Hotchkiss guns into action, and V Battery opened a
heavy fire on the retreating enemy. The Infantry must have been
heavily engaged, as many of their wounded were at the advanced
dressing station, close to the bridge-head, and we passed several
dead. During the afternoon we reached Dahra Barracks (Turkish),
which were littered with Turkish dead. Still pressing on towards
nightfall, we came in touch with an enemy flank patrol, and
opened fire on them with rifles, Hotchkiss guns, and artillery. It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
was now very late at night, so we returned back to Dahra Barracks
for food and water for the horses. It was about 2 <small>A.M.</small> when we
made down our beds and lay down for the night. When we had
been in bed about half an hour, the order came for the 1st and 3rd
Troops to saddle up at once, and I heard Mr Payne, the officer in
charge, tell the troop sergeant that we were going out on the flank,
on reconnaissance. On hearing the order, we jumped out of bed,
saddled up our horses, and in a few minutes we were off in the
early morning dusk. We were all tired and very sleepy, as we
had only had half an hour’s sleep, but we had a rattling good officer
in charge of us, always giving commands in a fine soldierly manner,
and a leader in whom we all had confidence.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></p>

<p>“As we neared the trenches we had fired on late the night
before, we met a Turk, who gave himself up. Later on we came
upon two Turkish officers, who gave up their revolvers and a
valuable telephone instrument. On reaching the trenches, we found
a dead Turk and one wounded man. We bound up his wound,
laid him down, and gave him some cigarettes, and then put up his
rifle to let the R.A.M.C. men know he was there, and when we came
back later he was gone.</p>

<p>“We were now not many miles away from Kut and Sannaiyat,
but on the north side of it this time. We had watched Kut from
the south side so long that it seemed impossible we could be where
we were then. We could see the 13th Division coming through
Sannaiyat, and we afterwards passed through what had been a
Turkish camping-ground, and kettles, dishes, and pans lay all over
the place.</p>

<p>“We returned back to camp about midday, and heard that the
officer in charge had been complimented for the reports he had
sent in, and which had enabled the Division we left behind at
Dahra Barracks to turn out at 5 <small>A.M.</small> that morning, and continue
the pursuit of the retreating enemy. After watering and feeding
our horses we commenced to feed ourselves. Porridge was made,
and bacon and tea were made, and we had a hearty meal, after
which we rested; but the place was beginning to smell, as the dead
Turks had not yet been buried....”</p>

<p><i>February 26.</i>&mdash;“Next morning we moved on to where we knew
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
the Regiment had camped, but on arrival the Regiment had again
gone on, but we went with the transport as escort. This was on
the 26th, and on arriving in camp at night, we heard that the
Regiment had been heavily engaged with the enemy’s rearguard, and
Sergt.-Major Goddard, S.Q.M.S. Edwards, Sergeants Bell and Hill,
had been wounded, Private Davis of ‘C’ Squadron killed, and thirty-three
wounded.... About 5 <small>P.M.</small> we again went on, intending to
overtake and rejoin the Regiment, which we failed to do, until they
were forced to call a halt as they were out of rations, and had
eaten their iron ration. This will give any one who reads this an
idea of the speed with which the Turkish rearguard was pursued
and continually harassed and defeated.</p>

<p>“We reached camp at one o’clock the next morning, the 27th....
On the way up we had passed much abandoned booty, as the
enemy, being hotly pursued, had to leave it to escape capture.
There were guns of the 18-pounder class, as well as small camel
guns which fired a shell not much bigger than a man’s two fists.
Thousands of rounds of artillery ammunition was lying strewn all
along the track of the beaten enemy. Rifles and small-arm
ammunition, equipment transport carts, and even a motor-car of
German manufacture....</p>

<p>“At night we rejoined the Regiment, who hadn’t a biscuit left,
but heard they had captured a Turkish barge, with a cargo of grain,
flour, candles, dates, and supplies of all descriptions, so they had
grain for the horses and food for the men. The transport arrived
in camp, but they only had enough for one day’s march; and although
the paddle-steamers followed us up, we were now a day’s march
ahead of the dumping-ground, and two days’ march in front of the
Infantry.”</p>

<p><i>February 28.</i>&mdash;“So next day, the 28th February, we retired back
a day’s march, and came upon the food columns on the bend of
the river.... On the 1st of March we remained in camp all day....
We got on board the captured barge that morning, bringing
away whole-meal flour, dates, surgical bandages, and took off a lot
of corn for the horses. M‘Nulty and Moss made chupattees of the
flour, baking corned-beef and dates and making pies, and we all
had a good feed....</p>

<p><i>March 3.</i>&mdash;“On the 3rd r&eacute;veill&eacute; was at 5.30. After attending to our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
mounts we had breakfast, and then a big party of men, of which I
was one, were ordered to stand-to for fatigue. We were marched
down to the river, a distance of two or three hundred yards, and
commenced to unload barges, which had arrived that morning with
stores of all kinds, shells and bullets, and food for man and beast.
We soon transformed the bleak ground on the bend of the river
into a vast dumping-ground, and hundreds of tons of corn were
soon stacked in heaps on shore.... At 8 <small>P.M.</small> that night we
were again unloading a barge which we completely emptied of its
cargo. We had no rest that day, but we knew we had done some
good work.”</p>

<p><i>March 4.</i>&mdash;“Next day, the 4th, we remained in camp all day.
During the afternoon we heard that the General was holding a
parade to decorate men who were recommended for bravery on the
field. We were afterwards to get ready to move on the morrow,
as a report brought in by airmen reported a body of Turks holding
trenches a day’s march up the Tigris close to where they had a
pontoon-bridge across.”</p>

<p><i>2nd Lieutenant Guy Pedder&mdash;March 2.</i>&mdash;“What do you
think of it all? No doubt the papers have been shouting about
old Mespot lately. When I wrote my last letter I little thought
we should be quite so far on the next time I wrote. I think the
rout of the Turks must have been a complete surprise for even
our authorities....</p>

<p>“We went through the Infantry and crossed the Tigris above
Kut at 9 <small>A.M.</small>, Saturday, 24th. Curiously enough, I met Masson,
who used to be at Pat’s at Repton with me. He had been building
the bridge. We didn’t do much that day, as we were held up
when we tried to get round their flank; however, next day we
went a long reconnaissance. I got a small batch of prisoners, and
then we attacked the Turks’ position. I was commanding the
squadron, as Eve was commanding a wing. We advanced about
1&frac12; mile across the open under very heavy rifle-fire and shrapnel.
I lost both my sergeant-majors and two sergeants, besides others.
The Regiment lost 35 and only 1 officer (Lord): how we got out
of it I don’t know, as hardly any one came out without a bullet
through his coat, topee, or something. I tell you I lay pretty flat
when we weren’t advancing or retiring, but there was not a bit of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
cover! We camped down about 2 <small>A.M.</small>, and were off again about
6 and went about 30 miles, but the Turks had cleared early next
morning. We took about 300 prisoners and 6 heavy guns, and the
road was littered with ammunition, kit, shells, carts, dead animals,
&amp;c. The prisoners were in a very bad way and could hardly
walk....</p>

<p>“Luckily the weather has been perfect, except it has frozen
every night, and is quite cold in the day. I brought all my
bedding on my spare horse, but of course we haven’t got any
tents. None of us got the chance of a wash or shave for four
days, so you would have laughed if you had seen us. I am awfully
fit. Hope the next letter I write to you will be Baghdad: it’s
under fifty miles from here. Best love to all.</p>

<p>“The monitors did excellent work and recaptured the <i>Firefly</i>
and other boats.”</p>

<p><i>2nd Lieutenant J. O. P. Clarkson&mdash;March 3.</i>&mdash;“We started early
in the morning<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> and trekked to the Tigris west of Kut. The
Infantry had established themselves on the other bank, so we
crossed in the early morning and followed them up. When they
had cleared the trenches we went through to harass the enemy’s
retreat.... The next day we went in on what was supposed to be
the retreating enemy, and found it was the main body, consisting
of about 5000 men.... The next night we bivouacked by a
water-hole in the desert. We had some armoured cars with us,
and one of them got into difficulties a very short way off some
Turkish guns, but the next morning was still intact. The next
day we again went on and captured 400 prisoners and 12 guns,
6 of which were 5.9 howitzers, and one man found the breech-blocks,
which had been buried in another place. By this time we
were getting very short of food for the horses, but luckily we found
a barge laden with grain that had been captured, so we filled up
again.... We are now at a place about half-way between Kut
and Baghdad. The Navy here&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the monitors&mdash;did great work.
They rushed on ahead, and got right into the thick of it, firing
6-inch shrapnel at the Turk at a range of 400 to 600 yards. Every
gun on board was worked, and in every direction. They captured
several boats and barges, and what used to be the <i>Firefly</i>. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
Turks captured it at Kut, and have used it against us ever since,
and in a few days it is going to come up and shell the Turk. The
litter that was left behind by the Turks was awful&mdash;rags, clothes,
camp furniture, ammunition of every description, and bombs,
shells&mdash;in fact a bit of everything. We recaptured half a dozen
of our fellows who had been captured the day before, and they
had their boots and overcoats taken from them, as the Turks are
very short of both. They even strip their own dead as well as
our own for the clothes they can get off them.</p>

<p>“I also found a Constantinople paper which was written in
French, and which said the Germans had gained a great defensive
victory on the Somme against the English because&mdash;and here came
long explanations. Also that Verdun was as good as lost to the
French, &amp;c. I was also shown some post-cards from Germany,
but they were very badly written, and I could not decipher them.
There was also an ‘Illustratte Zeitung’ there, with wonderful
pictures showing how grateful the Pole was for the German
liberation scheme.”</p>

<p>(Lieutenant Clarkson read and spoke fluently both French and
German.)</p>

<p><i>Captain W. H. Eve&mdash;March 2.</i>&mdash;“Well, things are going <i>really</i>
well, and we are now forty-five miles short of Baghdad, and resting
a day or two. The difficulty is again supplies....</p>

<p>“I wrote you Friday last, February 23rd, and we moved at
4.15 next morning, 24th. The fight at the river-crossing had gone
very well, and we were sent over the bridge which our sappers
had built about 9 <small>A.M.</small> The Infantry were still pretty busy further
forward, and we waited about for three or four hours and watered.
Then we really thought our chance was coming of getting them in
the open, but their rearguard put up a very fine fight, and got
into nullahs and ditches, and our show ended in a dismounted
fight, and we weren’t able to turn them out, and so it ended at
dark. The squadron was out on flank guard and had next to
nothing to do, and only one man wounded, and one of Payne’s
chargers, his best of course, killed. We camped north of the
river, but weren’t in till midnight, and I can tell you we were
tired then. We had had nothing to eat, and there were no rations
up, so we turned in straight off. It had been a very hot day.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span></p>

<p>“Well, the Turks’ rearguard cleared off in the night and we
had got Kut. For they had evacuated it directly we got the
crossing of the river, to escape being bottled up there. Meanwhile
the other Corps had taken Sannaiyat, but the remnants of the
Turks got away from there too. The Turk rearguard really did
well. I did hope and think our day might have come, but it was
not to be. All the same there was nothing to grumble at, for we
had got Sannaiyat and Kut, and the whole of the Turks were
retreating as fast as ever they could.</p>

<p>“Our monitors came up the river as soon as Sannaiyat was
taken, and passed through our bridge early the next day. Then&mdash;that
is, Sunday 25th&mdash;the pursuit started. We managed to get some
food early in the morning and left camp at 7. I was advance-guard,
but we saw no Turks till the afternoon, except a few scattered
prisoners which we rounded up. In the afternoon the other Brigade
on our left found their rearguard and sent for us to help. They
were in a very strong position, Infantry and Artillery, and we were
sent in dismounted. The Regiment was on the left, ‘B’ and ‘C’ in
front, and ‘A’ and ‘D’ in support, under me. We were very weak in
numbers, only about 100 in the firing line from the Regiment, and
they were much too strong for us. We went on, of course, but
finally got held up, and we had a warm time. I took the support
line up to within about 100 yards of the front (two squadrons). The
Turks were shooting very well&mdash;rifle, Maxim guns, and their guns
too&mdash;and people behind thought we should be about wiped out. But
‘V’ behind us helped us no end, and when orders came to retire we
got out of it better than I expected, just before dark. ‘B’ and ‘C’
came back through me, and I then came, but by degrees. The men,
all of them, were topping. We had heavy casualties, but only a
very few killed.</p>

<p>“Only half of ‘D’ was there, as Payne with the other two troops
had been out on a reconnaissance all the night before, and so had
been left behind to come on with the supply column. Even so I
lost both sergeant-majors, two sergeants, and a corporal wounded&mdash;no
one killed. Sergt.-Major Edwards was only lightly hit in the leg
and will soon be back at duty, but Sergt.-Major Goddard was very
badly shot through the middle, and I am afraid was bad: I haven’t
been able to find out anything about him since, either, except that he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
was easier when he left the field ambulance. Sergeants Bell and
Hill were both shot through the face, and Corporal Heathman
through both legs. Lord was wounded, the only officer casualty.
We were lucky to get out as lightly as we did. The monitors helped
us too. I only had one horse very slightly hit, but shells fell right
amongst them and they were very lucky indeed, too. It’s an extraordinary
thing: if you are going to be hit, you’re going to be, and
if you’re not, you’re not, and that’s all about it. I was touched&mdash;my
clothes&mdash;by bits of shrapnel, and I got a bullet through my
revolver holster and then through my coat&mdash;near enough, but I
wasn’t touched. Corporal Watkins, my signaller, had two or three
through his clothes, one of which was stopped in his pocket by his
pocket-book.</p>

<p>“I rode Follow Me till danger threatened on the Saturday, and
then Caprice, and on this day, the Sunday, I rode Follow Me. We
didn’t get back to camp till 11.30, but we got food all right then.</p>

<p>“We had to go back, no support ready to push these people out.”</p>

<p><i>Monday 26.</i>&mdash;“Left camp 7.30 and marched across the desert to
strike the river much higher up&mdash;a long march, and wicked going
for the guns in places. I rode Caprice. We found the Turkish
rearguard in the afternoon&mdash;again very strongly posted. We were
rear Regiment of the rear Brigade and did nothing, and the other
Brigade found them too strong. But the Infantry were steadily
coming up, and the monitors were topping, going ahead like anything
and giving the Turks beans. They captured prisoners and destroyed
Turkish ships, and did no end of good work. We had a day’s food
with us, and just lay down where we were for the night. It rained,
but not much, luckily, but was bitterly cold.</p>

<p>“We advanced next morning, 27th (New College grind), at 7 <small>A.M.</small>,
but of course the Turk had gone by then. However, we rounded up
about 240 prisoners, a hospital, and a battery of six 5.9-inch guns.
We wasted a lot of time over this instead of pushing on, and in the
end got no distance that day, and the infantry were only a few miles
behind us.... It drove me mad. The Turks were obviously running
like smoke&mdash;abandoning guns, ammunition-carts, and equipment of
all sorts, and yet we didn’t push on. It’s beyond me altogether.</p>

<p>“A little farther on we found two large barges loaded with corn
and all sorts of things. These were providential, for we filled all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
our nose-bags and corn-sacks and got a little loot ourselves as well.
I took a Turkish trumpet, but I don’t suppose I shall keep it. But
we got useful things like chickens, ducks, candles, dates, sugar, &amp;c.
We then marched on about eight miles more and camped in the
desert just before dark. I rode Caprice and Follow Me. Later in
the evening Payne, with the other two troops, turned up with the
welcome supplies at last, and also our regimental transport. The
road of the retreat was a sight, every conceivable thing abandoned.</p>

<p>“Next day no supplies at all could be got forward, so we marched
<i>back</i> the eight miles to where the captured barges were, and had a
really welcome afternoon’s rest there. <i>I</i> had the most glorious hot
bath in a huge iron bath we got off one of the barges. I can tell
you we were dirty. We left in the small hours of Saturday, and
this was Wednesday, and you can’t imagine how dirty we were.”</p>

<p>“We marched again next morning, Thursday, March 1st, and
came about seventeen miles to where we are now&mdash;a most delightful
camp, right on the river bank.</p>

<p>“Two of the monitors are here. They <i>have</i> done well. They
have recaptured the <i>Firefly</i> captured from us in the retreat last year,
have taken a battery of guns here, and been up level with the
Turkish infantry in their retreat and inflicted tremendous losses.
They have sunk a lot of ships and taken over 2000 prisoners. And
all this when you think they are unarmoured&mdash;only supposed to be
proof against rifle-fire, and had all those heavy guns against them.</p>

<p>“I believe since the push started here we have taken 7000
prisoners, and their other casualties have been very heavy indeed, as
we know from their dead. We believe we have only a remnant in
front of us. Personally, I shouldn’t be in the least surprised if we
march into Baghdad almost straight, when we get going again....</p>

<p>“It is lovely weather and we are all as fit as fleas, not a man
sick. The horses, poor devils, of course, are showing it, and I
have one or two tender backs and withers, but not many. They
are just A1....</p>

<p>“It is a lovely day to-day, and the horses are spending the
whole of it grazing, while we are cleaning up, &amp;c. I have had a
real useful morning at it, and have also mended my own breeches.
In a few minutes I am going to have a hot bath. I hope we shall
get letters away somehow by the supply people going back empty.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
Whether this will catch this mail is a different thing, but you will
understand, and if you get my wire you will know all is well,
anyhow. I am most awfully fit&mdash;couldn’t be better....</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t be the least surprised if we get there now with
hardly any fighting at all; as it is, we have done little enough of it.
The Infantry do nearly all of it, and the monitors have <i>really</i> done
the pursuit, which we ought to have done. I do hope we go on
to-morrow. I fret at every day’s delay.”</p>

<p>These passages have been given as they stand, for they show the
generous impulse of a real soldier to award all due credit to other
Services. And in truth it would be difficult to say too much for the
resolute unwearied fighting of the Infantry during the two months’
struggle on the Tigris, or for the dash and courage of the sailors in
following up the pursuit. Nevertheless it is necessary to make
allowances for the impatience of a fiery spirit always longing for a
chance. Others had done well, very well, but the horsemen had
done all that horsemen could do&mdash;and that was not little.</p>

<p>“We were bucked enough last night, and then we got the great
news from France to crown all. It is only a telephone message as
yet&mdash;no details&mdash;just saying the Germans have retired three miles
on the Ancre.... We know nothing, not even of our own doings.
I expect the papers at home have made the most of our success
here, with very big headlines, &amp;c., until the news from France
comes to overshadow it. We do want news so badly.”</p>

<p>That was the feeling at every part of the vast battlefield. In
Europe and Asia and Africa and all over the seven seas millions
of men were fighting for the Empire and doing their duty nobly,
but “we do want news so badly” was the cry that went up from
all of them, and they had to be content with very little, to find
comfort and help in the smallest successes reported in a few vague
words over the uncertain wires.</p>

<p>At the moment all was going well with the Thirteenth. They
were not strong in numbers, for they had had casualties at times
since the beginning of the advance, and had besides lost many
horses from the wear and tear of the campaign. Captain Eve’s
squadron had been reduced to working as three troops instead of
four, and had no senior non-commissioned officers left. But the
men and horses were doing well, and the officers the same.</p>

above the collar-bone and coming out under his arm, only just

not have been, of course, had he been there.”</p>

<p>Another letter, written on the 3rd March, sums up the operations
of the last week and the position as it then stood. At the
risk of some repetition it seems as well to give it.</p>

<p>“Well, we had known pretty well for a week beforehand that
a serious attempt was going to be made to put a pontoon across
the Tigris above Kut as soon as the height of the river, which was
then in flood from the recent rains, permitted, and this was done
on the 23rd February; and during that night a Division was put
over, and we followed on their heels next day, the 24th, and in the
afternoon found a gap in the line of defence they were putting up
to cover the retreat of the fighting troops from the Sannaiyat position,
from which the big guns had been retired some days. The
delay in getting the pontoon over the river, due to the flood, had,
however, given the Turks just enough time to get the survivors from
Sannaiyat&mdash;where the fighting has been very severe and bitter, and
where the deep trenches were literally filled with dead&mdash;away, and
when we got through it was only to bump up against their rearguard,
who were well handled and fought so well that we had to
force them back, after three days’ fighting, from position to position,
and until the Navy came along with their monitors and flyboats,
and turned the retirement into a rout. The Turks then left so
quickly that they abandoned guns, trench-mortars, doctors and
hospital staff, a motor-car, shells, wounded, and many unwounded
men who could not keep up, to fall into our hands or the hands of
the Arabs, who kill, strip, and loot Turks and British alike, especially
when wounded. Among the prisoners were a few German
officers, and a few were also found among the dead. We were ordered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
to stop the pursuit three days ago by the Army Commander, as we
had finished our supplies and were getting far from our base, so
have been waiting by the river for the barges to come up; these
began to arrive last night, and are coming up fast, so we may expect
soon to be on the move again. We are now some forty-five miles
from Baghdad, and our friend the Turk may put up a fight at
Ctesiphon, although this is very doubtful unless he has been strongly
reinforced, which seems unlikely....</p>

<p>“The weather has on the whole been most lenient to us, for
although the cold at night has been intense and the winds strong
and bitter, we have only had a small shower of rain, and the days
are now getting quite warm. The men are well and cheery, and
the horses, which a few days ago were footsore and weary, are
picking up and ready for more work. The Regiment has fought
very well, and our casualty list&mdash;about forty in the last ten days&mdash;is
comparatively small.”</p>

<p>Such was the state of affairs when the Thirteenth received orders
that the advance was to be resumed on the 5th March. The writer
of that letter had longed for one gallop with his squadron. He
was to get it at last. But before his confident words reached those
for whom they were written his fiery spirit was at rest for ever.</p>

<span class="large">THE FIGHT AT LAJJ, 5TH MARCH 1917.</span></h2>

<p>“On the fifth,” writes Sir Stanley Maude in his despatch upon the
advance to Baghdad, “the supply situation having been rapidly
readjusted, Lieutenant-General Marshall marched to Zeur (eighteen
miles), preceded by the Cavalry, which moved seven miles farther
to Lajj. Here the Turkish rearguard was found in an intrenched
position, very difficult to locate by reason of a dense dust-storm
that was blowing and a network of nalas,<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> with which the country
is intersected. The Cavalry was hotly engaged with the enemy in
this locality throughout the day, and took some prisoners. A noticeable
feature of the day’s work was a brilliant charge made, mounted,
by the Hussars straight into the Turkish trenches. The enemy
retreated during the night.”</p>

<p>Such is the brief official account of an action which was one of
the most memorable in the history of the Thirteenth. In accordance
with the custom of the times, when extreme reserve marked
the despatches of the military commanders, no details are given,
and the very number of the Regiment which made the “brilliant
charge” is omitted. This reserve was probably necessary, yet the
charge was a gallant feat of arms, and, if not a triumphant success,
none the less creditable to the valour and discipline of the Regiment.
News of it would have stirred the heart of the nation.</p>

<p>Extracts from several accounts by those who were present will
be given hereafter; and it will be seen that they are not always in
exact agreement. They reflect in some measure the rush and confusion
which must always attend a Cavalry charge, and perhaps on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
that account they give a better picture of it than can be given by
any attempt at a general narrative. The pace of galloping horses
and the extent of ground covered make it impossible for any horseman
sharing in a charge to note all the incidents that occurred,
and it is equally impossible for him to remember in precise sequence
all that he did see.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it seems necessary to state briefly what happened
on this day as far as one can judge from the varying and sometimes
conflicting stories. Their discrepancies after all are mainly
on points of detail, and a fairly accurate view of the whole affair
can be formed by comparing them. The following facts appear to
be free from any serious doubt.</p>

<p>On the 5th of March, shortly before daybreak, the Cavalry
Division marched from Azizieh, the rest of General Marshall’s force
coming on behind them. The line of advance lay along the north
bank of the Tigris, mostly over flat ground, with some low sand-hills
on the right, away from the river. Somewhere between 9 and 10
o’clock the head of the force reached the village of Zeur,<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> and there
the Cavalry watered their horses. Half an hour or so later they
pushed on for Lajj, while the rest of the force halted for the
night.</p>

<p>Lajj was the point on the river where General Townshend had
left his flotilla and his hospitals before the battle of Ctesiphon in
November 1915; and it was rumoured that the Turks intended
to make another stand now upon the old field where General
Townshend’s advance had been checked.</p>

<p>At first there was no sign of an enemy, and the Cavalry
moved forward unmolested. The 7th Brigade was leading in the
usual march formation, the 13th Lancers, Watson’s Horse, in front.
Soon after the start, reports came in from some aeroplanes and
armoured cars which had gone on to reconnoitre, to the effect that
the country ahead was clear except for a Turkish convoy with a
small escort of Infantry, which was retiring in the direction of
Baghdad. After advancing another mile or two, the Brigade came in
sight of some scattered parties of Turks, and the Thirteenth Hussars
were ordered to come up abreast of Watson’s Horse, which were
under fire. They did so, “A” and “B” Squadrons advancing dismounted,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
and remaining for a quarter of an hour or so in action.
During that time they lost 2nd Lieutenant Welstead and several
men, wounded by rifle-fire from concealed Turks.</p>

<p>It was then about 11.30 o’clock, and the day was a bad one for
seeing. A strong east wind had risen at the backs of the Cavalry,
and was sending along in front of them the “dense dust-storm” of
which General Maude speaks in his despatch. Through this and
the mirage the Thirteenth could make out, not very clearly, the
supposed convoy, two miles or more away.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_175" src="images/i_175.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Their commanding officer now called up his four squadron
leaders, and sending “C” Squadron under Captain Steele out to the
right to cover his exposed flank, ordered the rest of the Regiment
to advance in echelon of squadrons extended. The ground was
flat and covered with low scrub. “D” Squadron, which led, was
under Captain Eve, “B” under Lieutenant Dawson, “A” under
Captain Newton.</p>

<p>The Regiment had hardly got into the formation order when
a Turkish shell burst on its left, and rifle-fire opened from some
hidden trenches on broken ground ahead of the leading squadron.
No enemy guns or Infantry were then visible, nothing but the
convoy and its escort in the distance; but they were evidently there,
and it was impossible to say in what strength. As the aeroplanes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
had not made out any considerable body of them, they were presumably
few, so it was decided that the Thirteenth should ride
them down, and if possible gallop the convoy. The three squadrons
accordingly drew swords and advanced at a trot, when it immediately
became clear that they had in front of them not only
scattered bands of Turks, but Infantry in concealed trenches with
machine-guns and Artillery.</p>

<p>The order was then given to charge, and the eager horsemen
swept forward with a cheer. A first low trench or water-cut was
taken at a gallop, and some scores of Turks who held it threw up
their hands, but as the squadron galloped on, some of these men
seized their rifles again and fired into our men from behind, while
in front the charging lines were met by a blaze of musketry which
emptied many saddles, and broke the weight of the onset. Many
brave men pressed on to the edge of the farther trenches, and even
in places over them, but they found they could do little against
Infantry in such numbers and on such ground. Their Colonel saw
that the attempt to ride through was hopeless, and wheeling his
three squadrons to the right at a gallop, and then to the right
again, he withdrew them some distance until they were in comparative
safety near the point from which they had started.</p>

<p>They were still under fire, but the remains of the squadrons
rallied at once, and dismounted by order. The horses were sent
away to the rear, and the troopers advanced on foot and occupied
the trench which they had first taken. Leaving them there in the
hope of another advance, or at all events of recovering their dead
and wounded from the ground ahead of them, their Colonel went
back to consult with the Brigadier and bring up support.</p>

<p>He returned soon afterwards, but only to be wounded by a Turkish
bullet, and to find that the remnants of the three squadrons were
too weak to push back the Turks and could hardly hold their own.
They remained until dark in the Turkish trench. The rest of the
7th Brigade was similarly unable to advance, but held its ground
in spite of a bombardment from about twenty concealed guns and
a heavy rifle-fire, until the 6th Brigade worked round the enemy’s
left and threatened his line of retreat. Such of the wounded as
could be found in the darkness were then brought in.</p>

<p>So ended this day. The Thirteenth had shown a fine example
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
of combined dash and steadiness. They had charged boldly over
broken ground, and immediately after the charge had re-formed and
gone forward again on foot, as ready to fight as ever in spite of
their heavy losses. For they had lost heavily. Of the officers who
had led the Regiment into the charge, three had been killed, one
disabled and taken prisoner, and five wounded. Of other ranks,
twenty-five had been killed and fifty-two wounded. Among the
wounded officers were the Colonel and the second in command.
The senior squadron leader was dead, and another was badly
wounded. One squadron leader only came out of the charge unhurt.
In all, about one-half of the officers and men who rode at the
Turkish trenches were killed or wounded.</p>

<p>Of the three officers who died in the charge, the most prominent
was the Captain of the leading squadron, Eve, who fell sword in
hand among the Turkish Infantry. Many of his brother officers have
borne witness to his courage and character. No braver soldier ever
rode in the Thirteenth, and none was more beloved. The other
two were newly joined 2nd Lieutenants, Rolfe and Lynch Staunton,
who had not seen a shot fired before that day.</p>

<p>The following are extracts from letters and diaries bearing on
the story of the fight. As the narrative in the text has been taken
mainly from Colonel Richardson’s account and the Regimental Diary,
others are quoted before these.</p>

<p><i>From Lance-Corporal Watkins, D.C.M., to the Hon. Mr Justice Eve.</i>&mdash;“I
was with your son, the (late) Captain W. H. Eve, on the 5th of
March, when he was killed, and I was wounded almost directly afterwards.</p>

<p>“I was his signaller in most of the engagements in which we
took part, and I should like to state, sir (although I am not in a
proper position to do so), that he was the bravest man I have ever
seen under fire, and under whom it was my good fortune to serve.”</p>

<p><i>May 23, 1917.</i>&mdash;“On the 5th of March 1917 we had been on the
move since early morning after three days’ rest, and about 3 or
4 o’clock in the afternoon we had word back from the advance-guard
to say that they had got in touch with the Turks.</p>

<p>“We formed up, and your son, who (as I expect you know) was
squadron leader of ‘D’ Squadron, received some orders from officer
commanding Regiment, and we were ordered to advance.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span></p>

<p>“We went along at a canter, myself and Trumpeter Wren (he was
afterwards killed) riding behind the officer commanding squadron.</p>

<p>“I noticed Captain Eve pulling his sword out of the scabbard,
and shortly afterwards we all followed suit and we started to gallop.</p>

<p>“The squadron then had orders to wheel to the left, and Captain
Eve, who had gone towards the right flank, dropped behind and
I stayed with him.</p>

<p>“We followed behind the remainder, and I saw a Turk just in
front of me put his rifle to his shoulder, and was going to fire at
Captain Eve, but I just managed to get there in time to prevent him
from doing so.</p>

<p>“Soon afterwards I saw a pal of mine (Private Jones, D.C.M.)
lying on the ground badly wounded, so I dismounted and tried to
get him out of it as best I could, and I then lost sight of Captain
Eve and the remainder of the squadron.</p>

<p>“I did my best for my pal, but his wound was fatal, and I could not
get him on my horse, so I looked about me to see if I could get help.</p>

<p>“I saw Captain Eve about twenty or thirty yards [off?] taking
about twenty Turks prisoners at the point of his sword. He must
have seen me, as he left the prisoners and came over towards me
and told me to get mounted and draw my sword and go along with
him.</p>

<p>“There were about fifteen or twenty Turks in a nullah a short
distance from us, and they were firing at us and the other men
lying about wounded and otherwise.</p>

<p>“We galloped towards them; Captain Eve jumped over to the
other side of the nullah, and I remained this side.</p>

<p>“The odds were strongly against us, but I think we did a good
deal of damage to the Turks, before your son fell from his horse,
right into the centre of the Turks.</p>

<p>“I cannot say whether he was shot or if he had been bayoneted,
but I did not see him move after that, so he must have been killed
outright.</p>

<p>“His horse galloped away, and I was told later that it had seven
bullet-wounds in its neck.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> I was left by myself then, and I really
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
did not know what to do, so I looked over my shoulder to see if
there was any one near to give me a hand, when I saw a Turk about
five yards away ready to fire at me, and before I had time to do
anything I got a bullet through my left arm close to the shoulder;
the same bullet broke the blade of my sword, which was in my
right hand. My horse took me back out of it, as I was too dazed
to do anything myself; and if it had not been for ‘Chicko,’ I
should not have been alive to-day. I was told later that Captain
Eve, when found, still had his sword tightly grasped in his hand,
and I am sure it will be some consolation to you to know that he
died a hero fighting to the last.</p>

<p>“I may also mention several occasions before that in which he
proved himself one of the bravest.</p>

<p>“He rescued a wounded man from out in the open under very
heavy fire and at close range, and on the 25th of February 1917,
in a dismounted attack on the Turks, he bandaged several
wounded men up, regardless of the danger to himself in being
exposed to heavy fire in the open.</p>

<p>“A bullet [hit?] him on that day, but luckily it hit his revolver-belt,
and glanced off without doing him any harm.</p>

<p>“I was lying by the side of him at the time, and he said to me,
‘Watkins, I think we are both marked men,’ as I had been hit
three times without causing any wound.</p>

<p>“One bullet passed through the sleeve of my tunic, and
another stopped in my pocket, in a book that I carried, after
passing through my pay-book; and I also got hit with a shell-case
on my foot, which only caused a slight bruise, and I was able to
carry on.</p>

<p>“I hope you will not think, sir, that I am trying to flatter
myself in this letter, and making you think I am a hero, but I
have only put down how things happened, and let you know as
best I could how your son met his untimely death.”</p>

<p><i>Major Twist&mdash;March 1917.</i>&mdash;“I feel I must write and say how
we shall miss dear old Billy. You will have heard how he met
his death from those who were actually with him at the moment,
and though I was quite close to him I suppose the dust and confusion
of the charge, and also my being myself wounded, prevented
my seeing him killed. He was, I know, most gallantly leading
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
his squadron, and fell from his horse without a word. I believe
if he had been asked to choose, this was the death he would have
chosen, and I remember him often saying that if he had to die
he would like to be killed on his horse. His men are heartbroken,
and it was a sad day for the Regiment when we lost
him.”</p>

<p><i>Captain E. Wingfield Digby, V Battery, R.H.A.</i>&mdash;“Well,
here we are just outside Baghdad.... The saddest part of the
whole show to me is poor old Eve’s death&mdash;he was just one of
the best fellows on earth&mdash;anyway he lost his life charging the
Turk (intrenched). I believe he took his man, and was then
shot through the head from below&mdash;the bullet entering under his
chin. The Thirteenth lost pretty heavily that day; we got very
heavily shelled too&mdash;lost all our layers casualties, and a direct hit
on one gun and one waggon,&mdash;it was a very dusty day and high
wind, and one couldn’t see a yard. And when the wind dropped
and mirage lifted in the evening, the Turks could easily see us in
the open, and fired at us from three different directions.”</p>

<p><i>2nd Lieutenant Guy Pedder&mdash;March 15.</i>&mdash;“I am afraid the only
comfort I can give you is that he was killed instantaneously, and
also mounted, in a brilliant charge&mdash;a death which I know he
would have preferred to all others.</p>

<p>“I remember him telling me at Makina that personally he
didn’t think a man could have a finer death than in jumping a
large fence out hunting, but his was infinitely finer leading his
squadron (I was directly behind him) straight at a small nullah
full of Turks. He was probably shot by a Turk not more than
two or three yards off. I did not see his body afterwards, as I
was hit myself very shortly afterwards; but Mr Payne did, I believe,
and no doubt he will have written to you.</p>

<p>“It is most awfully sad, and I shall feel it all the more when
I get back to the squadron and he isn’t there. I never saw a
braver or more fearless person than he was: he almost made it
impossible for any one under him to be afraid.”</p>

<p><i>Lieutenant Fitzgibbon&mdash;March 21.</i>&mdash;“I have seen by the way
what no other Regiment has seen or done in this war&mdash;that
is to say, the Regiment formed line and charged! It was a
damned fine effort, but rather a mad one. We had been given
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
wrong information by aeroplanes, and ran our heads against the
most beautiful trenches full of Turks I have ever seen. The old
Turk just sat back and waited for us, and, by God! he let us have
it. The noise was something impossible to describe: how the
devil we any of us ever got out of it I still do not know. The
dust did us in, but also saved us. Well, we eventually got out of
it, rallied, dismounted, and attacked on our flat feet, and had the
satisfaction of seeing the Turk evacuate his position at nightfall.
We rather got a dusting though.</p>

<p>“My squadron (‘A’) went into action very weak from previous
casualties, and we went in sixty-six strong and came out thirty-three.
Fourteen officers of the Regiment were knocked out and
five killed. Newton and I scraped out of it safely.</p>

<p>“We had a good many shows besides this one, but none so
good. It is something to be the only Regiment to have charged
as a Regiment, and it did jolly well. We were the first Cavalry
Regiment to enter Baghdad. We have lost our Colonel and also
the second in command, Twist; the senior squadron leader was
killed&mdash;such a nice fellow, Eve, shot through his head. I was the
first to find his body, and took his things off him. It was very
sad.”<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a></p>

<p><i>Colour-Sergeant F. Spanton, “B” Squadron.</i>&mdash;“After a few minutes
we were galloping towards the enemy with drawn swords, at a fair
pace. We were well received by the Turks, who blazed away at us
as hard as they could, and when we got close some of their shots
took effect, and one or two spare horses were galloping about.
After we had crossed the first trench my horse was apparently
hit and pitched over, causing me to be thrown. I landed between
the lines of Turks, and remained quiet, waiting to see what would
happen next. The Turks now had turned about, and were firing
over me into the rear of the squadrons. The Regiment changed
direction to the right, and passed out of my view; the Turks got
out of the trenches and continued to send a hail of bullets after
the disappearing squadrons. I watched this as I lay on the
ground, weighing my chances of rejoining the Regiment. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
Turks in front of me were now retiring, and moving to the left of
the trench, and I thought if I remained quiet they would all
probably pass me by unnoticed, and then I could get back to my
squadron again. But no such luck: as the tail-end of the Turks
passed by, one fellow stopped when he saw me, and raising his
rifle to his shoulder he fired point-blank&mdash;but missed&mdash;the bullet
not coming so near as the one that had cut the belt of my
haversack in half a few minutes before. This man, evidently disgusted
with his bad shooting, walked hurriedly away, so once
again I thought my chances of getting back were good; but a
group of three men coming along a little later came to see who
I was, and lugged me off to a dug-out. I had hurt my knee
rather badly when I was thrown, and couldn’t get along over
fast; this annoyed the Turks, as we were still under a heavy fire
from the British machine-guns, so they jabbed me in the back
with the butt of a rifle as a signal to hurry.... Sergeant Gilbert
was brought up to where I was, and duly deprived of his possessions.
After a few minutes Lieutenant Pennington<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> was brought
in. He was holding his wrist: he had been badly hit in the
forearm, the bone being broken. I tied him up with my field-dressing,
and made a plug for him until we could find a dressing
station. In the meantime, Private Morrison had been brought
in, and he also was shot through the arm and was bleeding freely.
We were now hurried off, and came to a dressing station, where
the wounds of Lieutenant Pennington and Private Morrison were
dressed. We were now handed over to an escort, who had instructions
to take us to the Headquarters, 18th Turkish Division,
for interrogation. The escort made a wide chukker to get to the
Headquarters. After a while they called a halt, and motioned us
to sit down. Now they thought was the best time to change
clothes. They commenced with Lieutenant Pennington, taking
his puttees and spurs, and tried very hard to get a gold ring off a
finger on his broken arm, which must have caused him considerable
pain; but being unsuccessful they let him alone, and
turned their attention to Private Morrison, whom they robbed of
almost everything; next they came to me and took what the others
had left.... Now they turned to Sergeant Gilbert and served
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
him in a like manner. After they had got all they could out of us
they continued to walk to G.H.Q., where eventually we arrived.
Here we were interviewed by an interpreter, who spoke excellent
English, and who was wonderfully informed, but I am afraid the
satisfaction he got from us was little. I spoke to him about my
clothes and possessions being stolen by the soldiers, but he said
nothing could be done, as they were allowed to do it. Two
Turkish soldiers fighting for possession of my revolver were interrupted
by an officer, who thrashed them both and took it himself.
The Turks were still retiring and we were sent to travel with a Field
Ambulance Section.”</p>

<p>It will be seen that there was some measure of mercy shown
by the fighting Turks towards the men who fell into their hands,
but Sergeant Spanton’s diary goes on to describe the lives and
sufferings of the British and Indian prisoners during their captivity,
and the story is painful reading.</p>

<p>2nd Lieutenant Pinnington, who was wounded and taken
prisoner at Lajj, had joined the Regiment only a fortnight earlier
with 2nd Lieutenant Rolfe, after a long voyage from England by
way of the Cape and India. More fortunate than his companion,
he lived to be exchanged to England within a year. His account
of the fight at Lajj is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The 7th Brigade, to which the Thirteenth belonged, led the
way, one of the Indian Regiments&mdash;Watson’s Horse&mdash;furnishing
the advanced and flank guards. The Division had been on the
march several hours when the news filtered through that a Turkish
convoy, escorted by a company of Infantry, had been sighted a mile
or two ahead. The job of rounding up this convoy was assigned
to the Thirteenth, and the Regiment drew ahead in the formation
known as echelon of squadrons. We had not gone far when the
whizz of bullets greeted our ears, and the order came to dismount
for action&mdash;presumably owing to the impossibility, on account of
the dust, of seeing what actually did lie in front of us. A lull in
the dust-storm served to assure our leader that whatever opposition
there was could be ridden down, and accordingly, after advancing
a short distance dismounted, and snapping away with Hotchkiss
gun and rifle, we were summarily recalled, ordered to mount, draw
swords, and finally charge. Shells by this time were bursting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
overhead, and the storm of bullets through which we rode gave
the lie to the report that, with the exception of the convoy and
its escort, all was clear ahead. We were quickly on top of a
line of Turks who had abandoned their trench and were scurrying
back to join their comrades in the rear lines. The horrible
screeching told its own weird tale of the fate they met. In the
onrush I got ‘winged’ and was left, as I ultimately learned to my
cost, a few yards from the Turkish main-line trench. As I stood
there dazed amid the dust, I saw another squadron come galloping
up. It was a sight I shall not readily forget. The leader to the
fore with sword aloft, the line of panting horses, the grim eager
faces of the men, the flashing swords&mdash;I thought of Lady Butler’s
painting ‘Floreat Etona,’ and marvelled at seeing the living parallel.
Captain Eve was the leader, and as he approached ‘with a swiftness
not to be conceived,’ I shook my right arm, which was hanging
limply by my side, and shouted, ‘This thing’s shattered.’ ‘Hard
lines, old boy. Never mind,’ he called back, and was gone. The
line had passed and disappeared in the dust.</p>

<p>“When once again the dust had settled, the Turks, observing
that the attack was for the moment over, sallied forth from their
trenches to pay attention to the casualties. An Arab relieved me
of my possessions and led me to an officer in the trench. This
officer, on seeing me approach, forsook the machine-gun he had
been manipulating and shook my uninjured member warmly&mdash;a
thing which no good Mahomedan should have done, as such
contact with the ‘infidel’ is forbidden in terms of Koran regulations.
Some one applied a tourniquet to my arm, which was still
dripping, and I was taken to a bend in the trench where I came
across Sergeants Gilbert and Spanton, and Trooper Morrison, the
only other survivors amongst those who had fallen into Turkish
hands. The horses of the two sergeants had been shot down,
and Morrison was suffering from a wound in the forearm. We
were led out of the trench and across the open country to the
Headquarters of the Turkish forces (instead of rounding up a
convoy the Thirteenth had ridden through a Division), and in the
course of our journey to the rear had ample opportunity of realising
how much nastier is the effect of British shrapnel than that of the
Turk. Arrived at Headquarters, we were separated and interrogated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
in a very polite manner by one who spoke English fluently. In
this interrogation, to my surprise and the credit of the enemy,
there was not the slightest suggestion of coercion to extract information.
After a few hours’ rest, Morrison and I, with some
wounded Turkish soldiery, were given seats in a rickety waggon,
and with Sergeants Gilbert and Spanton marching behind, we set
out. It was early the next morning that the palm groves of Baghdad,
topped by the domes and minarets of the city’s many mosques,
came to sight. At Baghdad, Morrison and I were taken direct to
a hospital, where a Jewish doctor, Alalou by name, dressed our
wounds and gave us food and drink.”</p>

<p class="caption">SCENE OF THE FIGHT AT LAJJ. 5TH MARCH 1917</p></div>

<p>Lieutenant Pinnington was afterwards sent on to Mosul, and he
writes: “It is perhaps worthy of mention that on many occasions
during my imprisonment there I received compliments from Turkish
officers on the bravery of the British Cavalry in making their ill-fated
charge on the 4th [? 5th] March.”</p>

<p>Captain Newton, the one squadron leader who came out unwounded
from the “ill-fated” charge, evidently took much the
same view of it as his subordinate. The entry in his diary for the
5th March is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Marched 4.45 past Zeur almost to Lajj, where enemy reported.
Tried to take them on mounted, but found them intrenched and
very strong, and had rather a bad time. Retired a bit, and came
into action dismounted, and held on all day. Awful job getting
wounded away at dusk. Eve, Lynch Staunton, and Rolfe killed.
Pinnington missing. Colonel, Twist, Dawson, Pedder, Welstead
wounded. Total casualties eighty-seven. Retired to biv. near
Lajj bend, getting in soon after 10. An awful day, wind and dust
terrible. A little rain at night. Took sixty-six men into action,
and brought out thirty-three.”</p>

<p>In a letter of the 21st March 1917, Captain Newton gives a
somewhat longer account.</p>

<p>“The poor old Regiment has been through some pretty troublous
times, and has been pretty well knocked about, but it’s done most
awfully well, and got a great chit for itself....</p>

<p>“I last wrote on Saturday the 3rd. They gave us a rest next
day. We got orders to parade at 4.45 <small>A.M.</small> (on the 5th), and it was
awfully cold and dark turning out. We had an uneventful march
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
for some time, but quite unexpectedly came in touch with the
enemy in the middle of the morning. We came into action against
them, and there seemed to be very few, so the Colonel decided to
ride them down. Then we found that we were wrong! There
were a few scattered Turks in nullahs who ran away or held
up their hands as we rode over them, but just behind were some
beautifully concealed and very well-dug trenches, and we fairly
caught it from rifles and machine-guns. We rode right up to them
though, and even in places across them, but we couldn’t do anything,
and had to rally and go about, and eventually came into
action dismounted. It was a pretty tough business though, as one
did not know where any one was. Young Welstead was hit in the
arm before we charged, and Twist during it. Billy,<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> Vavie,<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> Lynch
Staunton, Rolfe, and Pinnington could not be accounted for at first,
but later in the day we got forward a bit and found poor old Billy’s
body, and Vavie lying out wounded, and several other wounded
men. Poor Billy was shot through the head, and death must have
been instantaneous. He must have been shot in the very act of
jumping a nullah, as his body was lying in it as he had fallen with
his sword by his hand. Vavie was very badly hit in the knee, and
must have had an awful day, as we couldn’t move him till after
dark, and the Turks had been at him and taken all his equipment
off, and even the rings off his fingers, I believe. Rolfe’s body we
found after dark, and Lynch Staunton’s next morning. Pinnington
we have no news of, and he must be a prisoner, as his body was
never found. When we had established ourselves in a nullah to
hold on we continued to have a few casualties, as we had very little
cover. Young Pedder got one through the shoulder, and soon after
that Jimmy (the Colonel) got one through the arm. Then my
troubles began, and I found myself in sole command of such as
there were of three squadrons. ‘C’ were not with us, and it was
not till much later that we got news that they were away on our
right, though they had had a few casualties. We hung on all day,
and I had a pretty anxious time, as there were an awful lot of
Turks in front of us, and I couldn’t make out what they were
going to do. We had frightened them pretty badly, and they cleared
off after dark. We collected all we could find and brought them
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
in; but we had no stretchers, and it was pretty hard work, and
there were a lot of snipers at us all the time. Vavie was splendidly
plucky. He was one of the worst cases, and we got him in on a
ground sheet, and although I knew he was in agony he kept quite
cheery, and would only apologise for the trouble he was giving us.</p>

<p>“I was simply dead-beat when we got back to the horses. I
don’t think I ever felt so done up in my life before. We reached
bivouac about 10 <small>P.M.</small>, and I was overjoyed to find Charles<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> safe
and sound, and to find I was only second in command and not
commanding officer.”</p>

<p><i>2nd Lieutenant F. N. Payne to his Wife&mdash;March 13-16.</i>&mdash;“At last I am
able to write to you, and very lucky I am to be alive to do so, for
we have been through a terrible time, and suffered heavy losses....</p>

<p>“On March 5th the Cavalry, pushing on ahead of the army, ran
into the enemy again at Lajj, thirty miles below Baghdad. The
aeroplanes and armoured cars reported that they were about 300
strong, and protecting a convoy that was trying to get away safely,
so we were given orders to round them up and bring them in, while
the rest of the Division attacked the convoy. Our Regiment was
sent round the right flank to get behind their trenches, the river
being on the left. We started out in extended order, and gradually
worked up to them, when about a hundred Turks seeing us coming,
walked out of the nullah they had been firing at us from, and the
Colonel gave ‘Draw swords-charge.’ The hundred dropped their
arms and surrendered. We charged through them, and ran into
their concealed trenches that were packed with a solid mass of
Turks, and three thousand rifles from all directions, together with
shrapnel and bombs, came pouring into us, and eighty-two of our
good fellows went down. We had to get out the best way we
could, and retire about a mile with what was left, and get away
the remaining horses and advance on foot, for we had to recover
our wounded at all costs: they were left all over the place as their
horses reared and plunged till they toppled out of their saddles.
Then came the worst part of all. I rallied all the men near me,
after finding I was not killed or even wounded, and forty of us all
told and cut off from any possible help kept the Turks in their
trenches, and in about three hours made good the nullah, and held
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
it till dark with our Hotchkiss gun and twenty rifles. We, of
course, all expected to be wiped out, which would have been an
easy matter, but they were satisfied to stay where they were except
for a number of the boldest who walked out and stripped our
wounded. I killed two of them myself, but we could not stop
them, and that day the Turk seemed to return to his ancient
savagery, for we found they had murdered several of our chaps that
were lying helpless. Poor Eve was killed instantly, to the sorrow
of every man in the Regiment: he always wanted to die in a charge,
but we do want him so badly, and it seems such a shame that he
isn’t there to enjoy the victory in Baghdad. Dawson was very
lucky to come off with his life&mdash;he fell right up against one of their
sniper’s holes and couldn’t move with a shattered knee, and the
Turks had taken everything off him, but couldn’t get his ring off, so
threatened to shoot him as they had done to seven others alongside
him, together with the brave chap who tried to carry him in.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a>
Eight of us worked our way up the nullah, and held them off till
dark, when we got him out of the open. We had had nothing to
eat or drink since 3 that morning, and had three miles of ploughed
land to carry sixteen men in without stretchers, and fired on all
the time. Some got hit several times on the way back. When we
called the roll in the darkness, we found that thirty-two had been
killed and twenty-six wounded. The Colonel, who is the bravest
man next to Eve, was hit only at the very last: he was always to
be seen in the thickest, carrying up ammunition and encouraging
the men with a smile on his face, and you could hardly see him for
the dust of bullets hitting the ground round him. The second in
command was hit, Eve killed, and three young officers who had
just joined killed. Pedder got a nice one through the shoulder,
and two others wounded, so that Jeffrey and myself found ourselves
alone in the squadron, absolutely staggered at being alive. I lost
most of my men&mdash;all the best, of course&mdash;and have now only thirteen:
we had to make two troops out of what was left of the four.
When we moved on and saw the position, we stood aghast that it
was possible, and the army commanders of the Infantry when they
came on, sent messages of their deep admiration and gratitude for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
the work we had done that would have delayed them considerably.
I believe our Colonel is to be decorated later on, and we are
having our reward now in that ‘For Valour’ our Regiment was
chosen to garrison Baghdad when it fell.</p>

<p>“There were some very sad cases in these chaps that were killed.
Out of five new officers that had joined and not been under fire
before, three were killed and one wounded, and none of them more
than twenty-one years of age. Only a few minutes before we went
into the charge, and were halted awaiting orders, Eve called out one
of my men<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> to present him with the D.C.M. for extraordinarily fearless
bravery in the last show that had just been sanctioned that morning,
and I promised to send a cable home for him if we got up alongside
any of the gunboats. Another fellow, a great big, rough, hard-working
fellow, remarked that if we could have one in the troop we could
just as easy have two, and he was going to get it in the next show
we got into or die in the attempt. I saw him try: he rode past me
yelling and whooping and ran his sword through the foremost
Turk, only to be bowled over the next second. When I went out
later to find him, my sergeant, who had a shattered thigh, told me
not to risk myself any further, as he had seen a Turk blow his
brains out, as they had also done with the boy who had just won
his medal. I have finished up after being in fifty shows without
a scratch: they’ve whistled past my nose, through my coat and
everywhere, killed four of my horses, one after another, and never
touched me. You may call it providential or the hand of God. I
don’t know what it is other than miraculous good luck, for it’s not
right to think that I should be spared when such good fellows as
Eve are struck down, and all three poor new chaps, who had never
heard the terrible swish of a bullet pass their heads before, to meet
death the first time. It doesn’t seem right that I should be
spared.... I had absolutely no thought whatever about my soul
or the hereafter, in fact everybody seemed to be in a state of
pleasant anticipation. When Eve galloped by me and I looked
to him for orders he had a beautiful smile and just sailed along,
and I waved my men on to follow him, and next second his soul
had left his body. I don’t believe he had a thought of death, or
that it meant anything to him. I know only when we had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
breathing-space in all these occasions did I worry about anything,
and that was how you would get along, and whether I had left
everything satisfactory.... Lynch Staunton, whose father was a
Senator from Hamilton, was one of the six new subalterns who
hadn’t been under fire before.... Poor fellow, he rode right down
into the Turk trench and walked his horse along it over the Turks,
that were as thick as gooseberries, as much as to say you are
my prisoners; and they certainly would have been, had not that
murderous fire from their main position bowled him over. They
took him prisoner, but we found his body next day: they had
dressed his wound, but later decided he would be a hindrance to
carry along, so murdered him and took everything off him.”</p>

<p>2nd Lieutenant Guy Pedder, one of those wounded in the fight,
writes to his mother from the hospital at Amara: “No doubt
you will have heard by now how we ran into it on the 5th, but in
case you haven’t I will try and give you a rough idea of what
happened. After camping at Azizieh for four or five days (I wrote
to you from there), the Cavalry Division moved at 5 <small>A.M.</small> (we were
centre Regiment of the leading Brigade) on March 5th with orders
to camp at Lajj, which was about twenty-six miles away, the flying
people having reported all clear. After we had gone about twenty
miles we halted and watered, and fed on the river bank, three monitors
steaming past us up-river, and an aeroplane over our heads&mdash;quite
a dramatic picture. At 10.30 we moved off again, and almost
immediately a sand-storm started, the strong wind taking all our
dust out in front of us. We went about five miles, when one of our
armoured cars brought in a Turkish officer, and the news that
there were a few of the enemy scattered about, who were probably
only waiting for us to collect them as prisoners (like the lot we took
in the pursuit), so we got orders to move out to the right to verify
this or collect prisoners. Eve told us this, and quickly changed
on to his favourite mare. Three squadrons moved out to the right,
the fourth (‘C,’ Stirling’s and Ormrod’s squadron) right out to the
flank; ‘A,’ ‘B,’ and ‘D’ then advanced in line of troop column extended
and almost immediately came under heavy rifle-fire. We walked about
half a mile and then trotted; the dust was awful and you couldn’t
see more than one hundred to two hundred yards in front; all of
a sudden, through the dust, I could see a lot of Turks in the open
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
and in a nullah. Eve gave the order, ‘Draw swords&mdash;form line&mdash;gallop,’
and before we knew where we were we were into them.
Some stood up and surrendered, others lay flat on their backs
and shot at us at two or three yards’ range; two fellows let off
their rifles right in my face, but missed both Matches<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> and me.
There was a small nullah at the part of the line where ‘D’ charged,
and the Turk lying flat was pretty well safe, but we got a certain
number; the noise was tremendous, bullets from revolvers, rifles,
and machine-guns cracking all round. Beyond the first nullah,
and running at right angles to it, was another much deeper, and
we gave the Turks holding it a splendid target. I lost sight of
Eve, who was just in front of me at the first nullah, but his
orderly who was shot (wounded)<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> close by him, tells me he
was shot from two yards’ range, as he was bending down to
charge a group of Turks. At any rate, he must have been killed
instantaneously.</p>

<p>“There were a great many dead horses and empty saddles by
now, and I tried to rally all the men who were near me; it was
extremely difficult, as we were under very heavy fire at very short
range; there was deafening noise and a hard wind blowing, and
if you collected men in bunches, the bunches would very soon have
a machine-gun on to them, so what men I got under hand I kept
extended, and galloped a fair way back and handed over the horses
and went up dismounted. The Turks’ guns had now got our range
and were very annoying, but their shells were bad, or I should
not be writing to you now. I met Jeffrey, and we all went on
by short rushes together, until we met the Colonel, who told us
roughly where to go, and we got into the nullah we had first
charged, and there we held on till dark, when we collected the
wounded, who were lying out in front. I was hit clean through
the shoulder about 2 <small>P.M.</small>, having got through the charge and
dismounted attack, and when I was sitting in the nullah talking
to the Colonel, who got hit in the arm very shortly after me.</p>

<p>“We had nine officers casualties&mdash;two killed, Eve and Rolfe
(from Aldershot, first time under fire), two missing, believed wounded
and prisoners, Lynch Staunton and Pinnington (just joined from ‘A’),
and five wounded, Twist, Colonel, Dawson, Welstead, and self. ‘A,’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
‘B,’ and ‘D’ lost very heavily. ‘D’ had thirteen wounded and
thirteen killed, and I think we got off lighter than ‘A’ or ‘B.’
Dawson is the worst hit of us five; the Turks robbed him of
everything, even taking his water-bottle and ring&mdash;we left him at
Sheikh Saad, and I hope he won’t have to lose a foot. Poor old
Thirteenth, we fairly ran into it. My troop sergeant and best
corporal were killed, new sergeant-major badly hit. And now I
hear we have crossed the river again to the right bank, and are
three miles west of Baghdad. I wish I was with the Regiment&mdash;it’s
sickening....</p>

<p>“Later.   News has just arrived Baghdad has fallen, only five
days after I was hit: isn’t it sickening I was not there?...</p>

<p>“I am awfully sorry about poor Billy Eve, but he died just
the death he would have preferred, certainly a very noble one. He
was one of the most fearless people under heavy fire I have so far
seen, always rushing about looking after any one who was hit.”</p>

<p>It need hardly be pointed out that 2nd Lieutenant Pedder,
being when he wrote in hospital at a distance from the front, was
not in a position to get the most accurate information about
casualties or other matters connected with the Regiment. The
Regimental Diary, written by the Adjutant, states the casualties
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>“Killed, 3 officers;</td>
    <td>22 British other ranks.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Wounded, 5 officers;</td>
    <td>52 British other ranks.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Missing, 1 officer;</td>
    <td>4 British other ranks.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="i4">Horses, 54 killed;</td>
    <td>36 wounded.”</td>
  </tr></table>

<p>This gives the total of casualties at nine officers and seventy-eight
other ranks&mdash;of whom four officers and twenty-six other
ranks were killed or missing. How many wounded died of their
wounds does not appear, but none among the officers. The horse
casualties were ninety, of which fifty-four were killed.</p>

<p>The following is an account of the day given by Private Massey
of “D” Squadron in his diary of the war:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Next morning, the 5th of March (a day to be remembered in
the annals of the Thirteenth Hussars), we moved off about 5 <small>A.M.</small>
and proceeded up the Tigris, in the teeth of a terrible sand-storm,
which blinded both horses and men, and through which we could
only see 80 to 100 yards ahead of us. Suddenly, out to our front,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
we heard the sound of rifle-fire, and bullets whizzed amongst us.
The report came through that a Turkish convoy was attempting
to get away, and it was decided to make an attempt to capture it.
Still under fire, the order was given to ‘draw swords,’ and we
continued to trot on in extended order. As we got nearer, the
fire became heavier, and the whizz-whizz of the bullets, as they flew
in amongst us, told us we were in for ‘hot stuff.’ Then we got the
order to canter, and when within a hundred yards of the Turks
(whom we could now see through the sand-storm lining the parapet
of the first-line trench) the order to ‘charge’ was given. Digging
in our spurs, and with a loud shout, we charged the Turks in their
trenches. Seeing us on top of them, the whole front line surrendered,
holding up their arms, and some were waving white
flags. The order was given to bring the left shoulder round, and
immediately we commenced doing so, the enemy’s guns opened
on us with shrapnel; and he also had a second line 800 yards
behind his first one, and we came under a heavy machine-gun and
rifle fire, and our losses were rather heavy. On wheeling out of
action, but still under fire, the Colonel rallied his men. The
order was given ‘dismounted action,’ and No. 3’s of sections led
the section’s horses to the rear, while Nos. 1, 2, and 4 of the
sections formed line and charged with fixed bayonets. I went
to the rear with the gun-section’s horses, and many wounded
men were being helped to the first-aid dressing station.</p>

<p>“I had gone all through the charge, riding my own horse, and
leading the horse carrying the Hotchkiss gun. I saw M‘Nulty at
my side during the charge with his revolver in his hand. He was
very excited and shouted across to me, ‘Come on, Charlie’; a second
later he fell shot in the head. My section-corporal was wounded
in the elbow, and his horse had a nasty shrapnel wound in its neck.
That I got through it all without a scratch seems hardly believable.
Riderless horses, and horses carrying automatic rifles were
galloping madly about, and I was told that I was the only one
who had stuck to my led horse all through the charge.</p>

<p>“But the Turks played a dirty game on us, even those who
had surrendered in the first-line trench fired on us when we had
passed over them; and several men, whilst dressing our wounded
where they had fallen, were shot at point-blank range in the head.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span></p>

<p>“But to return to my former subject: after the rally, and
when a halt was called with the led horses well out of rifle-range,
and knowing that the section-corporal was wounded, and that
they would probably want the gun and ammunition up in the firing
line, I decided to volunteer to return with it to the trenches. I
asked the sergeant-major, and he gave me permission to take it
up. I was about to start up with it, when I saw Private Galloway,
who had caught a gun-horse which had got loose in the charge,
leading it up towards the firing-line on foot. I thought that a
much better way, and though one could not go so fast leading as
riding one and leading, it had the advantage of offering a much
smaller target for the enemy’s machine-gunners. I told the
sergeant-major my opinion, and he took my riding-horse from me,
and I started to lead the gun-horse towards our fellows in the
enemy’s captured first line. On coming in view of the enemy, he
opened on me with a machine-gun, and bullets were kicking up
the dust at my feet, and buzzing round the horse and myself. I
passed close to Corporal Taylor, who was lying wounded on the
ground waiting for the Field Ambulance to fetch him in. He
shouted to me to clear off to the right, as he had already been
wounded once. I didn’t think I was drawing the enemy’s fire on
him until he reminded me of the fact. After that I began to run,
and seeing me coming up with the gun, two N.C.O.’s rushed out
and hurriedly took off the ammunition. They didn’t want the gun,
and gave me a stern order to ‘get away as quickly as you can.’
I then started to run back with the gun-horse. When I had gone
a dozen yards I remembered that I had left my rifle behind, and
turned round to go back and fetch it, but the sergeant told me to
go on and leave it. It was certainly a hot corner, and perhaps it
was best I did.</p>

<p>“I then started to run back as fast as I could go, as the Turks
knew I was bringing up ammunition as well as I did, and meant
to make it hot for me, but I got back quite safely. On the way
down I passed the Colonel talking to a wounded man.</p>

<p>“As soon as I had got back, however, Sergeant-Major Tassie
called me, and ordered me to go up to the line again with more
ammunition. I again started for the first-line trench. I arrived
in safety, and having put it down was told to stay in the trench.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
Here we hung on till nightfall, as the wounded on the field pinned
us to the trench. Several were killed in the trench by rifle-fire,
and the Turks heavily shelled V Battery, knocking out a gun
and limber and killing several men. Whilst in the trenches the
Colonel and Major Twist (second in command) were both wounded,<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a>
and the command fell on Captain Newton of ‘A’ Squadron.</p>

<p>“Towards night the Turks retired, so we collected the wounded,
and slowly, very slowly we returned to camp, three miles to the
rear, the end of a hard and terrible day. On arriving in, after
taking over our horses we watered at the river-side.”</p>

<p>The writer proceeds to describe how in trying to get a bucket
of water, he was carried away by the stream and nearly drowned.
He was rescued, and the day’s entry finishes: “After getting into
bed it started to rain, so I put on M‘Nulty’s cape and British
warm, laying it all over the bed, as I knew poor Mac would never
want his any more.”</p>

<p>To close the story of the fight at Lajj, the Colonel’s account
of it is given in his own words. He had commanded the Regiment
throughout the day, had led it in its charge, and after rallying it
when the charge was over had taken it into action again dismounted.
Conspicuous for his courage among many brave men, he had won
the admiration of all; and the wound which disabled him towards
the close of the action was happily not severe enough to prevent
his commanding the Regiment again.</p>

<p><i>Colonel Richardson.</i>&mdash;“The following extracts are taken from a
letter written home about the middle of March, when events were
fresh in my memory:&mdash;</p>

<p>“We started on the 5th of March, leaving camp an hour before
dawn, and our orders were to march the Infantry to Zeur, twelve or
fourteen miles on, and the Cavalry to Lajj, about six miles farther on
still. Our Brigade, the Seventh, were leading, and we made Zeur,
where we watered and fed the horses a little before 10, and we marched
again at 10.30. Soon after we started armoured-car reports came in to
say that there was a small convoy ahead of us proceeding in the direction
of Baghdad with an escort of about 250 Infantry, and that otherwise
the country was quite clear. The formation of our Brigade was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
the usual formation, with the 13th Lancers (Watson’s Horse) leading
and finding one squadron advance-guard, and one squadron each on
right and left flanks; then the Machine Gun Squadron, Thirteenth
Hussars and 14th Lancers, and V Battery R.H.A. We had gone about
two miles when our Brigadier ordered me to take the Regiment up
abreast of Watson’s Horse with a squadron as advance-guard, and
soon afterwards pointed out what he took to be the convoy on the
march, and hinted that we might be able to get in on it with the
sword and round it up. And so, having had a good look at this
supposed convoy, which was about two and a half miles to our
right front, I called up the squadron leaders, explained the situation
to them, and sending ‘C’ Squadron well out to the right or exposed
flank to work to the north of some small hillocks, I ordered ‘D,’
‘B,’ and ‘A’ Squadrons in that order to advance in echelon of
squadrons extended. (I should say here that the day was an
exceptionally bad one for visibility, as a strong east wind had got
up and was carrying along with us all the dust we raised and a good
deal more, which filled the air and made it difficult to clearly
distinguish things.) Of course a Regiment in this order covers a
lot of ground and takes a certain amount of time to get its formation,
and even before the formation was complete a shell bursting on our
left warned me that we were seen, and that the enemy had at least
one gun, and made me wonder whether the convoy was just a convoy,
or whether it was not a gun or two with their ammunition-carts.
At this time too, rifle-fire was opened on us from apparently a
trench, for no Infantry were then visible, a few hundred yards to
the front of the leading squadron; at the same time I heard rifle-fire
well away to our left, showing that the advance-guard was
coming into touch with the enemy. All this convinced me that
we were up against a much bigger thing than the scattered bands
of Turks reported by the aeroplanes and armoured cars, but
already the leading squadron was on top of the first line of Turks,
and the latter, about forty or fifty in number, were already
running for all they were worth, or standing with their hands up.
Some of these latter, I am told, picked up their rifles after we had
passed and fired into our backs, but very few of that first lot
reached their friends; they were either “stuck” or taken prisoners.
In the meantime our impetus had carried us on two or three
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
hundred yards, and into a very heavy rifle and machine-gun fire,
from what I took to be a big nullah or water-cut some eight
hundred yards to our front. Men and horses were dropping right
and left, so I tried to wheel them right-handed and backwards
until we had crossed the trench, or as it proved, small water-cut,
from which the Turks had first opened fire on us. Having crossed
that, I halted the remnants of the three squadrons (‘C’ Squadron
was still operating by itself out on the right) some three or four
hundred yards farther on, dismounted them, sent the horses back
out of rifle-range, and advanced on foot until we had reached
this trench originally held by the Turks, and which was still full
of their equipment and rifles. I may say here that the test to
which I put these squadrons&mdash;viz., of halting and dismounting under
fire, and when the squadrons were all mixed up and actually
retiring at a gallop, albeit a slow one&mdash;was a very high one, and
the way in which they responded was beyond all praise. It was
only when we reached the Turkish trench that we were able to
take a breather and take stock, and then only did I fully realise
the cost of our ride. Major Twist, I heard, was hit, though slightly;
Captain Eve was missing, and it was feared killed; Captain Dawson
missing, Lieutenants Rolfe, Pinnington, and Lynch Staunton
missing, and Welstead hit; my trumpet-major killed, and my
orderly badly wounded, and a number of sergeants and men
missing. It was patent to me that the men who were missing
must be lying, if hit, between us and the big nullah in which the
Turks were, and that our only chance of getting to them was
to draw the Turks out of this nullah, and it was very soon
apparent that we could not do this by a frontal advance without
considerable reinforcements: so I went back to Brigade Headquarters
to consult with the Brigadier, and pointed out to him
that I thought the quickest and cheapest method was to outflank
the Turkish position to the northward. He said he would consult
with the Divisional Commander, and in the meantime sent up two
squadrons of the 14th Lancers to fill the gap between us and
the advance-guard of Watson’s Horse. Soon afterwards I heard
that the 6th Brigade was being sent to find the left flank of the
Turks, and I believe they did find it, but late in the afternoon,
showing that we could not be up against much less than a Turkish
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
Division, and that I believe was corroborated later. In the meantime
we hung on to our line, but were quite unable to advance,
and it was whilst sitting in this shallow water-cut that about
4.45 <small>P.M.</small> I was hit by a rifle bullet in the right forearm. At the
clearing hospital I was able to ascertain from the books that night
and next morning the approximate extent of our casualties from
wounds, and since then I have had a few corrections and additions
to make, with the result that I can append a pretty accurate list
as under:&mdash;</p>

<table class="list2">
  <tr>
    <td>Killed&mdash;Captain Eve, 2nd Lieutenants Rolfe and Lynch Staunton.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Wounded&mdash;Major Twist, Captain Dawson, Lieutenant Pedder, 2nd Lieutenant Welstead, and myself.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Missing&mdash;2nd Lieutenant Pinnington (reported a prisoner of war).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><span class="i4">Killed&mdash;25 N.C.O.’s and men.</span> <span class="i4">Wounded&mdash;80.</span></td>
  </tr></table>

<p>“The wounded men are all most extraordinarily cheery, tremendously
pleased with themselves, and keen as can be to get fit
and go back to the Regiment; and I am glad to say that quite 50
per cent of the wounded cases are very slight, and if not already
discharged from hospital, are likely to be there only a few days
longer.</p>

<p>“At about 4.30 or 5 o’clock the enemy opened a heavy bombardment
with about twenty guns, knocked out one if not two of
the guns of V Battery by direct hits, and at the same time
opened heavy rifle-fire, and it looked as if they intended to make
a strong counter-attack. The event, however, proved otherwise,
for as soon as darkness fell, about 6.30, they withdrew from their
positions in haste; we were able to get all our wounded in, and
eventually retired a few miles to the river. Next day the advance
was resumed, and we were then able to judge the strength of the
position, where the Turks evidently had intended to put up a big
rearguard fight, and it became apparent that the shelling of ‘S’
Battery of the 6th Brigade from their left rear had caused the
Turks to realise the danger in which they were of being cut off, and
had consequently hastened their retreat. The Regiment received
congratulations from many Divisional and Brigade Commanders for
the fine show they had put up on this occasion, and it naturally
was very pleasing to us to realise that we had effected good work,
and that our heavy casualties had not been altogether in vain.”</p>

in Mesopotamia, on Monday, the 5th of March, 1917.</i></p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span></p>

<p>General Maude’s view of the action is given in a letter to
Colonel Symons: “Your old Regiment did spendidly during the
advance here, and particularly on the 5th inst., when they made a
mounted charge and got well into the Turks, although they lost
heavily in doing so, as they got hung up in some trench systems.”</p>

<p>It may be noted that the loss in killed and wounded suffered
by the Thirteenth at Lajj was greater than in the famous charge
of the Light Brigade at Balaclava. The comparative nearness to
England, the dramatic setting, and other circumstances, combined
to make Balaclava a name of glory. The charge of the Light
Brigade will always be for Englishmen one of the most splendid
deeds in the history of the race. Lajj is, and is likely to remain
for the nation in general, a name almost unknown. But to the
Thirteenth it will always be one of the Regiment’s great days, for
the level sands by the Tigris saw that morning in the dust-storm
a death ride just as brave and devoted as the one which has
become immortal.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.<br />

<span class="large">OCCUPATION OF BAGHDAD.</span></h2>

<p>The 5th of March, however glorious, had been a heavy day for
the Thirteenth, and their ranks were sadly thinned.</p>

<p>But the Thirteenth formed only one unit of a pursuing army,
and the Cavalry had to push on without delay to follow up the
retreating Turks. At dawn on the 6th, therefore, the Regiment was
again on the march.</p>

<p>One squadron, the one which had been commanded by Eve,
remained for some hours with the transport in Lajj, to bury the
dead and make further search for any wounded who might still
be lying on the field. While they did so their Colonel, and all the
wounded officers and men who had been brought in, were embarked
and sent down the river to hospitals in rear of the army. The
dead were buried together in a nullah on the field.</p>

<p>The rest of the Regiment, under command of Captain Steele,
marched out weak in numbers, but still fit for further efforts, and
proud of themselves. Their goal, Baghdad, now lay only thirty or
forty miles ahead of them, and in common with the whole army
they were eager to see the hard fighting of the past three months
crowned by the capture of the famous city.</p>

<p>They had not long to wait, for only five days later the British
flag was flying on the citadel of the Turks; but before that
happened the brave enemy was to make one more stand, and take
a further toll of British lives.</p>

<p>On the first day of the advance the Cavalry met with no serious
opposition. They were tormented by another dust-storm and shelled
by the retreating enemy, but they suffered little loss and made
some prisoners. The line of march lay over the battlefield of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
Ctesiphon. This position, says General Maude, though strongly
intrenched, was found unoccupied. “There was evidence that the
enemy had intended to hold it, but the rapidity of our advance
had evidently prevented him from doing so.” The Cavalry believed
that their swift and resolute attack at Lajj had accelerated the
Turkish retreat and spared the army a possibly serious rearguard
action there or at Ctesiphon, and it seems not unlikely that they
were right. At all events Ctesiphon was not held, and the Cavalry
bivouacked that night some miles beyond it, at Bawi.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span></p>

<p>But, however this may be, the next day showed that the Turks
still meant to fight. About eight miles below Baghdad a considerable
river, the Diala, runs into the Tigris from the north, and bars
advance up the left bank, along which lies the road to Baghdad.
The Turks had destroyed the bridge over the Diala, and as the
river was at that time about 120 yards broad, with a strong current,
it was a formidable obstacle. The enemy was not apparently in
great strength, but he had more than once shown that he could
conceal his troops with effect; and whether his Infantry was in
strength or not, the farther bank was “defended by numerous guns
and machine-guns, skilfully sited,” while the ground in front of
them was absolutely flat, with no cover. To force a passage was
therefore no easy matter, and no attempt to do so was made that
day.</p>

<p>The fighting that followed during the next three nights and days
was desperate, and there is no incident in the whole campaign more
creditable to the British Infantry than the repeated attempts to
establish a footing on the right bank of the Diala. How attempt
after attempt was foiled with heavy loss, the Turks destroying our
pontoons and slaying the brave men who manned them, and how
seventy of the Loyal North Lancashire got across in spite of all,
and held their ground for twenty-two hours, and were at last relieved,
has been told by others. It is a fine story. But not until the 10th
of March was the Diala in British hands. The Turk had made a
gallant stand in defence of the City of the Khalifs.</p>

<p>In this fighting the Cavalry had no direct share; but their work
meanwhile had been hard and useful. When the advance along the
left hand of the Tigris was held up by the Turks, it was decided
to send a force across the Tigris with the view of turning the
Diala position and getting at Baghdad from the south and west.
Accordingly on the 8th of March a bridge was thrown across the
Tigris, and the Cavalry, followed by an Infantry force, passed over
to the right bank.</p>

<p>During that night the force marched in a north-westerly direction
towards a place called Shawa Khan, which the Turks were reported
to be holding. The march was much impeded by ravines and water-cuts,
and was necessarily slow; but the Turks offered no serious
opposition, and during the morning of the 9th Shawa Khan was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
occupied, the enemy retiring to another position a mile or two
farther back. This also was approached and attacked, but was
still in Turkish hands at sunset.</p>

<p>The Cavalry during the earlier part of the day had been operating
on the left flank of the force, away from the Tigris, but the horses
being in distress for want of water, it was temporarily withdrawn
to the river bank in the afternoon. In spite of some shelling and
rifle-fire the Cavalry had suffered little loss, and the Thirteenth
had till then had no casualties; but while watering their horses
they were annoyed by some sniping from the opposite bank,
and a promising young officer, 2nd Lieutenant Clarkson, was unfortunately
killed&mdash;shot through the heart. He was the fifth
officer of the Regiment who had been killed since the campaign
began.</p>

<p>That night the enemy evacuated their position and the force
pushed on.</p>

<p>“On the morning of the 10th,” says General Maude, “our troops
were again engaged with the Turkish rearguard within three miles
of Baghdad, and our Cavalry patrols reached a point two miles west
of Baghdad railway station, where they were checked by the enemy’s
fire. A gale and blinding dust-storm limited vision to a few yards,
and under these conditions reconnaissance and co-ordination of
movements became difficult. The dry wind and dust and the
absence of water away from the river added greatly to the discomfort
of the troops and animals. About midnight patrols reported the
enemy to be retiring. The dust-storm was still raging, but following
the Decanville Railway as a guide our troops occupied Baghdad
railway station at 5.55 <small>A.M.</small>, and it was ascertained that the enemy
on the right bank had retired up-stream of Baghdad. Troops
detailed in advance occupied the city, and the Cavalry moved on
Kadhimain, some four miles west of Baghdad, where they secured
some prisoners.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile the force on the left bank of the Tigris, having forced
the Diala, had also pushed on, and on this same morning, the 11th
of March, they also entered Baghdad. The British flag was hoisted
over the citadel; and the town, which was being looted and set
on fire by Arabs and Kurds, was rapidly reduced to order. In the
afternoon the gunboat flotilla with General Maude on board came
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
up the river in line-ahead formation, and anchored off the British
Residency. The capture of Baghdad was complete.</p>

<p>Thus ended, in triumphant success, General Maude’s advance
upon the capital of Mesopotamia. It had meant three months of
severe and at times desperate fighting, during which the British
force had lost heavily. But it had meant also the utter defeat of
the Turks on their central front in Asia, and the restoration of
British prestige in the East.</p>

<p>Indeed, it meant much more; and in writing this history of the
Thirteenth it seems desirable to point out the full effect and
significance of the victory in which they shared.</p>

<p>The recapture of Kut a fortnight earlier had already produced
a striking effect. The ‘Times History of the War’ referred to this
in strong terms:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Nor,” it said, “was the effect confined to the Middle East.
The Commander of the French armies telegraphed his warm and
sincere congratulations on ‘this splendid feat of arms,’ and the
defeat of the Turks made a great impression everywhere. Of its
immediate practical result upon the course of the War in Asia
there could be no question. Within a week the Turkish forces
which had invaded Northern Persia were in full retreat for their
own border, and the projected Turkish movements on the Euphrates
were given up. In fact, the ambitious offensive of the enemy
upon this central front in Asia had collapsed like a pricked
bladder. The principle of a concentrated advance on the Tigris
had already been justified.”</p>

<p>Now Baghdad had followed Kut, and the immediate result of
the second capture is thus described in the same ‘History’:&mdash;</p>

<p>“So fell Baghdad, the immediate base of Turkish warfare in
Persia and Mesopotamia, and one of the most famous cities in all
the East. If the recapture of Kut had produced a great effect, it
need hardly be said that the fall of Baghdad made an impression
vastly greater. In Germany it was described with unusual frankness
as ‘a deplorable event,’ and on the Bosphorus the news of it
was received with something like consternation; while among the
Allies and all who sympathised with them it was hailed as a
striking victory and an auspicious opening to the campaigns of
1917. Indeed, considering that the Asiatic theatre of war was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
after all a secondary one, and that the capture of an Asiatic city
could hardly have any material bearing on the issue of the
European conflict, the weight attached to the British success
seemed almost disproportionate. But it must be remembered that
the conception of a great advance eastward by way of Turkey in
Asia was a fundamental part of the German scheme of world-politics,
and that the seizure by Great Britain of the eastern end
of the Constantinople-Baghdad railway meant a heavy blow to
this scheme.”</p>

<p>These words were written in 1917, within a few months of
General Maude’s entry into Baghdad. The subsequent course of
the war was to show that far from having over-estimated the
value of that success, the writer might have said more. Now that
the war has come to an end, there can be no doubt that the blow
struck by the British in Mesopotamia, together with the almost
concurrent victory of General Allenby in Palestine, had a material
effect upon the whole issue of the war. By themselves they could
not have brought about the complete triumph of the Allied cause.
Nothing but the defeat of the Germans in the west of Europe
could do that. But they meant, if duly followed up, the collapse
of the Turkish military power, and the striking out of the Turkish
Empire from the great confederacy. That meant the maiming of
the German scheme of world-conquest. Without the aid of Turkey
as a vassal, the Kaiser’s dream of a vast Eastern dominion could
never be fulfilled. And dominion in the East was no small part,
some even think it was the more important part, of his scheme of
world-conquest. This, however, is perhaps to say too much, and
in any case, great as was the effect of the fall of Baghdad, much
fighting had yet to be done, even in Mesopotamia, before the
Turks finally recognised that they were not strong enough to stand
alone against the British Empire. They had received a heavy
blow, but they were not yet conquered.</p>

<p>To return to the Thirteenth Hussars and their share in the
work of the Baghdad campaign, the following extracts from letters
and diaries may be of interest.</p>

<p>The Regimental Diary shows that on the 6th March, the day
after the fight at Lajj, the Thirteenth marched off at 6 <small>A.M.</small> with
the Cavalry Division, and marched “without incident to Bawi (four
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
miles north of Ctesiphon),” where they bivouacked. The next day
the Cavalry “moved in direction of Diala river” and “came under
shell-fire,” but apparently suffered no casualties. “Retired and bivouacked
near Bawi.” On the 8th the Cavalry Division marched “with
object of turning right flank of Turkish position.” At 5 <small>P.M.</small> the
Division was all across the Tigris and “march continued all throughout
night.” On the 9th, at 8.15, “shelled near Khair-el-Kharabeh,”
and at ten o’clock “took up position on left flank of Infantry.”
There the Regiment remained two hours, when they “withdrew and
retired to water,” on the banks of the Tigris at 1.50 <small>P.M.</small> “Sniping
by enemy from opposite bank.” In the afternoon the Cavalry returned
to their former position and bivouacked. “Transport shelled
during the day, but no damage done.” On the 10th some of the
Cavalry advanced towards Kadhimain, to the north-west of Baghdad;
but there appears to have been no incident to report except “wind
very high during the day.” Finally, on the 11th, the Diary has the
following entries:&mdash;</p>

<p>“4 <small>A.M.</small> Stood to.</p>

<p>“8 <small>A.M.</small> Marched with Division to Khair-el-Kharabeh, where the
Regiment received orders to proceed to Baghdad.</p>

<p>“12.45. Entered Baghdad. Proceeded to bridge across Tigris,
which had been destroyed by enemy prior to evacuation.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></p>

<p>“2 <small>P.M.</small> Returned to a palm bagh<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> on outskirts of town, where
‘A’ and ‘C’ Squadrons bivouacked. ‘B’ and ‘D’ Squadrons proceed
to Kazimain.”</p>

<p>“The Regiment was attached to the 35th Infantry Brigade for
garrison duty.”</p>

<p>In these curt and unemotional words the Diary describes the
march from Lajj and the entry into Baghdad. It would not appear
from this that the Thirteenth had any fighting during these six
days, or was much excited by the capture of the city. But Regimental
Diaries are not given to unnecessary eloquence. As a matter
of fact we know that the Regiment lost an officer killed, and it
believed that it had been specially selected, as a reward for its
conduct at Lajj, to be the first Cavalry Regiment to enter Baghdad,
and to form part of the garrison. The compliment was evidently
appreciated.-</p>

<p>One young officer of the Regiment, 2nd Lieutenant Payne,
speaks as if the work had been hard, and not free from fighting,
even after Lajj. He had passed some years in Canada, and had
perhaps learnt there to be more outspoken than the very reserved
British officer generally is. “Since that date” (3rd March), he writes
on the 13th, “we have been fighting day and night without any rest
or sleep, till men and horses dropped with exhaustion, and had
Baghdad not fallen the day before yesterday there would have been
few of the Thirteenth left to tell the tale.” His letter goes on to
describe various incidents of the past week. The following are
extracts:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Next morning, 4 <small>A.M.</small>,<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> the Division had to move on, and our
squadron was left as escort to the transport, which didn’t leave till
the afternoon, so we took our men back to the awful battlefield to
see if we could pick up any men alive, and to bury the dead. We
buried sixteen men and three officers in the same grave, but got
nothing in personal effects, as they had been stripped, some of them
naked. All the time we were working we had to keep a Hotchkiss
gun going to keep off the Arabs, who were coming in fast to pick
up loot, of which there was tons in the way of arms and
saddlery.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a>...</p>

<p>“That same night we passed through another strong point at
Ctesiphon that they had not stopped to defend, and in the moonlight
I rode over to see the great arch of Ctesiphon that is supposed
to have been built in the time of Nebuchadnezzar or one of those
birds. It has a great fa&ccedil;ade of about 200 feet high that opens into
a courtyard, and alongside is this wonderful arched roof that looks
as though it had been a banqueting-hall.”</p>

<p>The writer is a little out in his dates, but the majority of his
countrymen knew not much more about the matter than he did.</p>

<p>“The enemy had gone back to their last and strongest position
above Diala, where there is a fork in the river. We weren’t successful
in smashing that place, so our Division and half the Infantry
crossed the river with the intention of striking the railway north of
the city, and we were out three days and nights without any rest,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
trying to force a way round, and the farther we went the farther
we had to come for water, as it was death for men and horses to be
cut off from the river. In forcing our way down to water on the
morning of the 12th<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> we lost an officer and man, being sniped from
the other side of the river. We were all done up, no sleep, little
food, and the horses dropping under us after three weeks’ fierce
fighting, and slowly making our way to carry on the attack on the
flank of the Infantry, which always necessitated the enemy widening
his front and weakening his strength, when news came that the
Black Watch entered Baghdad at 5.30 <small>A.M.</small></p>

<p>“It was too good to believe, but then orders were passed down,
‘The Thirteenth Hussars will report at once to G.H.Q. at railway
station for orders <i>re</i> garrisoning town.’ There was new life in all
of us at once; we hadn’t had a sight of Baghdad and didn’t think
we were likely to for an age, but the next minute we were hoofing
it at a trot along the highroad that had been used for hundreds of
centuries, over trenches that the Turks had held the night before,
and over dead bodies of both attackers and attacked. But we got
into the city. One seething mass of Arabs greeted us; the same
scum that the day before would have delivered up any of our
wounded to the Turks now brazenly brought out wounded Turks to
us that were not able to get away in the rush, dirty devils always
ready to join in with the winning side, but always with an eye to
scrupper the unfortunate of either if they can catch him unprotected.</p>

<p>“After standing by for an hour or so Jeffrey was told to take two
squadrons and one squadron of machine-gunners to protect Kazimain,
three miles up to (?) the river. So I found myself in command
of ‘D’ Squadron, and here we are in the lap of luxury (Eastern).
Kazimain is where all the pilgrims come to the great mosque, and
is entirely composed of caravanserai sort of hotel quarters: there are
5000 of these buildings. We are quartered in the biggest, and even
the men are able to have a wooden bedstead to lie on each. It is a
big square building with a courtyard in the middle, in which we
have picketed over 250 horses comfortably. Jeffrey and I and the
Intelligence Officer have a large stone-floored room with four bedsteads
in it; there are no windows, of course, but you let down
great heavy wooden shutters when the sun is too hot. The Sheikh
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
(elder of the town) brought in beautiful carpets and bedding for us,
and the women and children in hordes followed us in the street, all
making a tinkly sort of yodelling song. They are in terror of the
Turks coming in, and sacking the place, and taking their women.
We weren’t looking our best by any means: no change of clothes,
unshaven, and unwashed for five days, the dust from the storms
begrimed into our skins, and our clothes in rags. But to-day we
are all happy and clean. The men, who haven’t had a bath or change
since January 24th,<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> can now be seen having their boots polished by
Arab children, and strutting about like lords; they do so love to
have something to order about. You would laugh to see them
when we take prisoners: they make them hold their stirrup-irons
while they mount their horses, and hand them their coats to put
on&mdash;anything for the sake of exercising power....</p>

<p>“However, it was all too good to be true&mdash;to go to sleep and
not get up till daylight, and have your sleep out, was too good to last
more than two days, and we have orders to turn the job over to
an Infantry battalion, and rejoin the remainder of the Regiment in
Baghdad, where we go into the Cavalry barracks, which no doubt
will be just as nice: but the heavenly paradise of it all here,
with the river alongside, and all the water you like, fresh good
green stuff, and milk. This is buffalo milk, but quite good, and we
get lettuces, onions, and mutton&mdash;in fact, we don’t have to open a
tin of any sort. Our bread is <i>chupatti</i>, the round flat things which
the Jews make....”</p>

<p>War certainly teaches a man to be content with the essential
things of life.</p>

<p>“The Mosque here is most beautiful&mdash;that is, the outside, for no
infidel is allowed inside the gate.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> It is simply enormous, and faced
with silver till it reaches the roof and four towers, which are gold.</p>

<p>“I went down the Bazaar yesterday afternoon, and bought a
pair of saddle-bags for five rupees. They are made of the very finest
carpet of true colours, bound with leather; it’s a shame to use
them on a horse, but my other ones are in rags from carrying so
many tinned foods.... I have never carried anything in the way
of loot about with me, nor let my men do so, because it is such
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
an incentive for the Turk to put a bullet through you if you are
wounded, and he finds them on you; but now the Mesopotamia
War is over so far as we are concerned, and we shall live like
human beings again under cover from the sun and cold nights, and
be able to think of such things. The rest of the Cavalry Division
are getting three days’ rest before pursuing the enemy farther up.
We, as far as we know, are to be in Baghdad for a while at
least....</p>

<p>“Late evening. I have just been taking a stroll round the town
in case we don’t see it again. The officers are allowed to go in
pairs armed, but we haven’t dared to let the men out yet; they
have been in trouble already, climbing their way on the roof to the
quarters of the Sheikh and pinching bedding; also there are intermittent
shots fired now and again from mysterious spots, and there
has to be a house-to-house search for any stray Turks in hiding.
We went through endless streets with the houses almost touching
across to each other. Every window is glassless, but securely
barred, and great wooden shutters slide down to shut out the hot
sun. Down by the river the Eastern picturesqueness is very
novel,&mdash;to see the Arabs lifting water by appliances that have been
used as long as the world was peopled; the coracles (round boats)
spinning round and round as they in time get across the stream:
they are allowed to spin, as it lessens the resistance to the current.
To get alongside the water and amongst the palms with their green
crop underneath is wonderful after weeks of the desert. I don’t
know of anything more depressing and hopeless than to&mdash;as we
often and often had to&mdash;be going all day in the broiling sun and
dust and wind, and find it hopeless to try and get to the river,
and must camp where we are, the horses unwatered, and every
one finished their water-bottles, and knowing that you’ve got to be
on the move at 4 <small>A.M.</small> again, with the expectation of meeting the
enemy.”</p>

<p>Surely the soldier on service earns his pay.</p>

<p><i>March 14.</i>&mdash;“We turned out of our delightful quarters at
Kazimain this morning, and have now taken over the Cavalry
barracks in Baghdad&mdash;a horrible, flyey, and hot place that is nothing
more than bare mud walls and filth, since the outside Arabs have
stripped it of everything. These brutes got in and looted the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
Bazaar clean; the civil population always expect that to happen
on such occasions, and just sit calmly by and watch them wreck
their shops.... I am writing this in agony from the flies. There
are five other chaps in this bare stone-floored room with me who
have their heads buried under their blankets, having given up any
attempt at reading or writing....</p>

<p>“We found absolutely nothing in the town. The Bazaar, as
the multitude of dusty and smelly arcades are called, are rows and
rows of little cubby holes with the meanest supplies of merchandise,
and as they were all ransacked when the Turks left, we could buy
nothing at all. The whole town is most disappointing, even were
it not half in ruins: everywhere is dilapidation and dirt....</p>

<p>“Gowan, whose father was a member for Vancouver, is in charge
of the armoured cars we have attached to the Cavalry; he is an
extraordinary daring chap, and when in France with the 7th
Battalion had the back of his skull blown away&mdash;which he carries
in his pocket&mdash;had a bayonet through his stomach, and was discharged
from the Canadian Army as no further use&mdash;is now the
admiration of every one for his daring exploits!”</p>

<p>Lance-Corporal Bowie’s diary, from which quotations have
already been made in earlier chapters, tells the story of the advance
from Lajj to Baghdad in very concise terms.</p>

<p>“On the following day, the 6th,<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> we carried the pursuit of the
Turks past Ctesiphon. A very bad sand-storm raged during this
day, making our progress very difficult. We bivouacked that night
near Bawi, and the next day was spent in a well-earned rest, while
a pontoon bridge was being thrown across the Tigris, which, during
the day, Turkish airmen tried very hard to destroy by bombing,
but only succeeded in hitting one of our ammunition waggons,
killing the entire team, drivers, and everything within a radius of
300 yards. The following day we crossed the Tigris without
opposition, whilst the Infantry fought their way across the Diala
river some miles farther up. We at once made a long night-march
to get at the enemy’s left flank, which we attacked, forcing him
back a distance of some two miles, bivouacking that night on the
ground from which we had driven the enemy. During the same
[day?] one of our officers was killed while we were watering our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
horses in the face of the enemy’s fire. The following morning we
started to blow up a railway bridge, but had to abandon this enterprise
owing to a terrific sand-storm which overtook us. After a few
more hours’ rest we proceeded on our way to Baghdad, where we
encountered no opposition, our Infantry having driven out the last
of the enemy’s rearguard during the earlier part of the morning,
the Thirteenth Hussars being the first of the Cavalry to enter the
city, which we did about 11 <small>A.M.</small> on the 11th March. The following
morning the pursuing Cavalry took Khasmain, whilst the Thirteenth
Hussars remained bivouacked in a large orchard. Having been
selected to garrison the city, we crossed the Tigris on the morning
of the 14th, and took up our quarters in the old Turkish Cavalry
barracks, which were situated just outside the citadel. These we
found to be in a filthy condition, and infested with vermin.
Happily our stay here was very brief....”</p>

<p>Captain Newton’s diary is also very concise, but as an example
of a day’s work during the advance, the following entry of the
10th March may be quoted. After noting on the 9th “horses and
men done,” the diary goes on:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Saturday, 10th.</i>&mdash;“Saddled up at 5.30. Brigade off to water
Jaffer’s Tomb. Left with ‘A’ and ‘B’ (right wing) to escort Divisional
troops. Two troops sent off on search for some missing R.E.’s
and wireless. Sent with remainder to escort 6th Brigade second line
down river to refill. Awful dust. Found dead R.E.’s in pontoon,
and punished Arabs. Went back to where we had left Division
leaving 4.30. Found Division 9.15. Awful trek in dust. Then
moved to Hilawiyni in gale and dust-storm. Reached bivouac
12.30. To bed 2.30. Orders to be saddled up by 6.”</p>

<p><i>Sunday, 11th.</i>&mdash;“R&eacute;veill&eacute;, 4. Gale still blowing....”</p>

<p>In a letter written from Baghdad the same writer gives a summary
of the whole march from Lajj.</p>

<p>“We had a longish trek next day (the 6th), but saw nothing of
the enemy, and we bivouacked about 6, but had no transport, so
not much food. Transport came in about midnight, but I’d got
my blankets with me and was fast asleep by 9 o’clock. We
marched at 6 <small>A.M.</small>, a bitter cold morning, but our mess-boxes had
turned up with the transport, so we started with our tummies
good and full.</p>

<p>“We spent an idle day, sitting about a good deal while reconnaissances
went out; but it was a long day, and we didn’t get in
till 9.30 in the evening, to find a grand dinner waiting for us. It
was midnight again before I got to bed, as there were a lot of
things to do. Next morning we were up at 4.30 and ready to
move at 6, but then heard we shouldn’t move till about 1, and
then cross to the other side of the river again. We lunched at
11.30, but didn’t move off till 2.30, and it was about 6 before we
were across the bridge. We trekked about all next day, and in the
evening heard we were to go on, and we did, but came up against
the Turk positions and couldn’t get on, so came back to bivouac,
thank goodness, as men and horses were nearly done in. It was
while we were watering in the afternoon that poor young Clarkson
was shot dead by a sniper, the only casualty we had that day, and
most awfully hard luck.”</p>

<p>Such is too often the lot of the soldier on service&mdash;long, dreary,
uneventful days with no excitement, nothing but discomfort and
fatigue; and then, suddenly, the call to show what his training
has done for him, and perhaps to give up his life for his country.
That is what sets apart and ennobles the profession of the soldier
and sailor&mdash;the constant readiness to face death. Women with their
quick perceptions understand and are grateful, nor do they alone
understand. In spite of all prejudices and jealousies, men too
know in their hearts that the first honour is due to those among
them whose choice and pride it is to guard the nation with their
lives.</p>

<p>“We were up at 4 <small>A.M.</small> and ready to move at 5.30. We didn’t
move till about 8, and then I was sent with two squadrons to escort
transport to refilling-point. It was not a particularly hard day’s
work, but it was another long day. It was 9 <small>P.M.</small> before I found
the Division again with my transport, and then we trekked on in
an awful dust-storm, and eventually reached our bivouac about
12.30. I got to bed at 2.30, was called at 4.30, and we trekked at
8. We crawled along, every one, men and horses, dead to the
world, did a bit of Arab strafing, and at 10.30 received the news
that the Infantry were going into Baghdad, and that the Regiment
was to march in to form part of the garrison. My word, we were
proud and pleased, and every one just brightened up, and we were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
as cheery as anything. We entered the town on the side of the
river, but couldn’t cross till a bridge had been built. However,
‘B’ and ‘D’ were sent off to occupy Khazimain, a town about six
miles away and a great religious centre, and ‘A’ and ‘C’ were told
to camp in a delightful garden, all green and shady with date-palms
and orange-trees. It was just like coming into fairyland
after the time we have been in the desert, and we felt so peaceful
and happy. Directly after we had fed I went to bed, and slept
and slept and slept till 7.30! It was grand.”</p>

<p>Private Massey, of ‘D’ Squadron, has also left an account
of the march from Lajj from the point of view of the trooper. He
describes how the Regiment marched nearly to the Diala river,
and how on the 8th March the Cavalry crossed to the right bank
of the Tigris.</p>

<p>“It was now beginning to get dusk. All that night, and
during the early hours of the 9th, we continued marching, going
in a north-westerly direction. We crossed many big nullahs,
which we found great difficulty in crossing. When daylight broke
we found ourselves within a few miles of Baghdad, and according
to rumour we were to attempt to cut the railway above Baghdad,
to prevent the Turks getting their rolling-stock away. We were
heavily shelled during the day, but our Regiment escaped without
casualties. We proceeded to water late in the afternoon, and it
took us a long time to reach it as the river was a long way off.
We were sniped at on our way, and on reaching the river we had
to go down to get water in buckets under the fire of a sniper on
the left bank of the river. Lieutenant Clarkson, of the M.G.
Brigade, brought a machine-gun into position on the bank, and
stood up trying to find the sniper with his glasses. He was
instantly shot through the heart and fell down dead.</p>

<p>“When we had finished watering, we moved into a big garden
with a large wind-wall round it. Here we had something to eat,
a piece of biscuit and a bit of bully. The horses were very badly
done up, but we soon moved on again. Where we camped that
night is more than I can say, as for the next few days I lost all
sense of our position, as we seemed to be all over the show, here,
there, and everywhere. Anyway, we camped somewhere in the
desert that night, close up to the firing line.</p>

<p>“The transport was shelled coming in, and suffered several
casualties amongst native drivers. We had six hours in bed.”</p>

<p><i>March 10.</i>&mdash;“R&eacute;veill&eacute; on the 10th was at 4 <small>A.M.</small> We fed the
horses and had breakfast, and afterwards saddled up and went to
water. Two troops were put to guard a signalling-post all day
which was on the top of a high mound, close to where the Turks
had had trenches the previous day, and from where we had been
fired on. It was pitch dark when we moved off, very late at night,
and the worst sand-storm in which it has ever been my luck to be
in came on. It was a terrible experience, and I never want to
experience such a storm again. How we reached camp, or who
led us in, I couldn’t say, but it ceased when we reached camp.
Got in after midnight, with nothing to eat and drink, and r&eacute;veill&eacute;
ordered at 3.30 <small>A.M.</small> next morning. Transport late at arriving in.
Lay down in our clothes and one blanket for a few hours, and slept
like the war-worn soldiers we undoubtedly were.”</p>

<p><i>March 11.</i>&mdash;“On the 11th we started off again early in the
direction of Baghdad, and met several parties of Arabs who were
fleeing from the city on entry of the British that morning....
After proceeding a little farther, word was passed down the line
that we were going to be the first Cavalry Regiment to enter Baghdad.
As we neared the entrance other regiments stood aside, and we
passed on and at last met a battalion of the Black Watch, who had been
the first Regiment to enter Baghdad. After proceeding a bit farther,
we came to Baghdad station, and here we halted for half an hour.
We then mounted again, and proceeded round the end of the railway....
We were now entering the city, but with the exception of a few
snipers all was quiet. White flags were everywhere, and after riding
through several streets we called a halt close to some Cavalry barracks,
which we entered soon after. Only two squadrons went in, however,
as there was not enough room for the Regiment. The barrack rooms
above the stables were roomy and airy, but filthy.... On the 14th the
Regiment moved into fresh barracks on the left bank of the river.”</p>

<p>There for the present we may leave the Thirteenth to get a
little rest, and to regain as far as possible the cleanness and
smartness which had suffered during the rough work of the march.
Their goal was reached, and they were part of the force which
had occupied the enemy’s famous citadel.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.<br />

<span class="large">OPERATIONS IMMEDIATELY AFTER CAPTURE OF BAGHDAD.</span></h2>

<p>Baghdad had been captured, and a heavy blow struck at the Turks&mdash;a
heavier blow perhaps than any one understood at the time; but
much remained to be done before the British Commander in
Mesopotamia could give his troops the full repose they needed.</p>

<p>In the first place, the Turkish force which he had beaten at
Kut and driven through Baghdad must be pursued in its retirement
northwards until it was destroyed or hunted away out of reach.
General Maude was too good a soldier not to know that the
annihilation of the enemy’s armed force, rather than the capture
of any city, was the real object to be kept before him. And the
necessity of a rapid pursuit to the north, up the line of the Tigris,
was all the more urgent because of the near approach of the flood
season. Control of the river “bunds,” or dams, and irrigation
works up-stream of the city must be secured, or it would be
possible for the Turks to cause extensive inundations, not only
crippling the movement of the British army, but doing serious
mischief in other ways.</p>

<p>Then it was important for the security of the military position
that the surrounding country on all sides, not only to the north,
should be cleared of Turkish troops for a considerable distance,
so as to allow of the pacification of the neighbouring Arabs, and
the free collection of supplies. To the westward there were
Turkish troops on the Upper Euphrates, which threatened mischief
down the course of that river on the British flank and rear. To
the eastward, on the Diala, it was believed that there were also
some Turkish troops, dominating a tract rich in crops and forage.</p>

  </tr></table>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span></p>

<p>Moreover, General Maude had to keep in mind the great
strategical considerations involved&mdash;the exertion of continued
pressure on the Turkish base in Asia Minor, and the possibility
of co-operating not only with the Russians on the right, who were
driving or following the Turkish invading force out of Persia, but
in a measure with General Allenby in Palestine. The Russians,
though weak, were comparatively near, and it might be feasible
actually to join hands with them. Palestine was far away, out of
reach, behind the great Arabian desert; but the harder the Turks
were pressed on their central front, the less strength they would
be able to spare for their right.</p>

<p>General Maude’s plan of operations therefore, after the capture
of Baghdad, was to follow up that blow without delay by pushing
out three strong columns. One was to strike at the Euphrates westward,
and occupy Feluja on that river, thirty-five miles from Baghdad;
another was to press the pursuit to the northward, up the line
of the Tigris and of the Baghdad Railway; the third was to move
out north-east towards the Persian frontier, so as to secure the
rich Diala district, and if possible, with the help of the Russians,
to crush the Turkish force retreating from Persia.</p>

<p>During the short campaign which followed, all these objects
were in a measure attained. By the 19th March the western
column had established itself on the Euphrates, and thus commanded
the whole course of the river down to the sea, clearing Maude’s
left and rear from Turkish pressure. The northern column had a
hard fight at Mushaidi, twenty miles up the railway line, where
the retreating Tigris force turned to bay, with the result that it
was, on the 14th and 15th March, driven from its intrenchments
and completely beaten, streaming away to the north in confusion.
The eastern column at the same time surprised and occupied
Baquba, a point on the Diala thirty miles from Baghdad.</p>

<p>It was with this eastern column that the 7th Cavalry Brigade
was connected; and indeed during the remainder of the war, which
was to last for more than a year and a half yet, the Brigade was
chiefly employed in the country to the east of the Tigris.</p>

<p>The Thirteenth Hussars were left at the close of the last chapter
in occupation of the Turkish Cavalry barracks in Baghdad, resting
after their severe exertions. But their rest was short, for on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
23rd of March, by which time they were becoming tired of the
heat and the dirt and the flies, they were warned for active service
again, and on the following day they rejoined the Brigade at
Baquba. The Regiment was now in good condition, men and
horses restored and fit for service, and the prospect of further
work in the open was hailed with pleasure.</p>

<p>General Maude’s despatches of 1917 show what the work was.
The Turks, heavily defeated as they had been, were by no means
inclined as yet to give up the game as lost, and the British forces
east of the Tigris soon found that the enemy was still capable not
only of resistance, but of determined attempts at offensive action.
His troops consisted of two main sections, the 13th Corps, which
was retiring from Persia, and the 18th Corps lately beaten on the
Tigris, but rallied and reinforced in a few days from the Turkish
reserves in the North. These two Corps began to act in co-operation,
and to threaten attacks upon the British eastern and northern
columns. It was an excellent example of the tenacity of the Turks,
and of their quick recovery after defeat.</p>

<p>“About the 26th of March,” writes General Maude, “there
were indications that a converging movement was being made by
part of the 13th Corps down the right bank of the Diala from
Deli Abbas, and by the 18th Corps along the left bank of the
Tigris ... apparently with the intention of assisting the withdrawal
of the 13th Corps from before the Russians.” These advances were
resisted by the British northern and eastern columns, the former
driving back the 18th Corps northwards, and the latter dealing
with the 13th Corps. “On the 27th the enemy made a determined
attempt to move down the right bank of the Diala ... but our
Cavalry, skilfully handled in some difficult ground, resisted the
enemy’s advance from successive positions, inflicting severe losses,
and finally checked the forward movement that evening. Next
day the enemy fell back towards Deli Abbas, followed up by our
Cavalry.”</p>

<p>On the 2nd of April the British and Russians joined hands.
From that time until the end of the month there was some stiff
fighting all over the country, and the troops suffered severely from
the heat, the constant dust-storms, and the difficulty at times of
getting water. The work of the Cavalry was incessant and very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
arduous, now in trying to get round into the enemy’s line of retreat,
now in falling back before him and luring him on into a position
where the Infantry could close on him, and always in covering the
front and flanks of the columns. There was no conflict of the
nature of that at Lajj, no mounted charge into the enemy’s troops,
but there was steady hard work, of great value to the army; and
of this the Thirteenth had to do its full share. General Maude,
who refers repeatedly to the Cavalry in his despatches, sums up in
the following words the effects of the operations in this part of
the country:&mdash;</p>

<p>“As a result of the fighting during the month of April the
enemy’s 13th and 18th Corps had been driven back on divergent
lines.... The 13th Corps had twice taken the offensive, with
results disastrous to itself, and the 18th Corps had been defeated
and driven from its selected positions on four occasions. Our total
captures for the month amounted to some 3000 prisoners and 17
guns, besides a considerable quantity of rolling-stock and booty of
all kinds. The objectives which we had set out to reach had been
secured, and the spirit of the enemy’s troops had been broken.”</p>

<p>Coming so soon after the winter advance and the capture of
Baghdad, this was a good piece of work, and creditable to all the
soldiery concerned, whose spirit never faltered. Indeed, according
to their General, “as conditions became more trying, the spirit of
the troops seemed to rise,” and to the end their discipline, gallantry
in action, and endurance were as conspicuous as ever. But their
exertions had of course imposed a heavy strain upon them, and
now that the enemy was for the time powerless for further trouble,
General Maude determined to give them the rest they needed.</p>

<p>“The increasing heat,” he writes, “now rendered it necessary
that the troops should be redistributed for the hot weather, and that
every provision possible under existing conditions should be made
with a view to guarding against the trying period which was rapidly
approaching. Whilst it was necessary to hold the positions which
had been so bravely won, and to strengthen them defensively, the
bulk of the troops were withdrawn into reserve and distributed in
suitable camps along the river banks, where they could obtain the
benefit of such breezes as were available, and where a liberal supply
of water for drinking, bathing, and washing was obtainable.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span></p>

<p>The Thirteenth, among other regiments, were allotted one of
these standing camps, a shady grove of palm-trees on the eastern
bank of the Tigris at Chaldari, about nine miles above Baghdad,
and very thankful men and officers were to settle down in it.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it may be observed, the Regiment did not begin
to enjoy its comparative peace and comfort until nearer the end of
May than the end of April. They marched into Chaldari on the
14th of May, but on the 16th they marched out again for another
week’s hard work under the blazing sun. Though the two Turkish
Army Corps had ceased fighting, the Arab tribes on the upper reaches
of the rivers above Baghdad had been giving trouble, and before
settling down for the summer it was found necessary to punish
them for some of their misdeeds. Columns were accordingly sent
against them, and to one of these, which operated on the Tigris,
the Thirteenth were attached. Some tribes were duly brought
to book, and the troops did not get back to camp until the
24th May, when the heat had become tremendous. But the
tribesmen had learnt that British troops could move against them
whatever the temperature might be, and the lesson was a very
salutary one.</p>

<p>The following extracts give the story of these two months, March
24th to May 24th, from a more personal point of view.</p>

<p>“Happily our stay here was very brief, every one being very
thankful to leave these so-called barracks, which we did on the
morning of the 23rd, rejoining our Brigade. The next morning we
recommenced our pursuit of the enemy, who were located by
Captain Robinson (with ‘C’ and ‘D’ Squadrons as a patrol) on the
banks of the Diala river the following evening. We attacked them
at dawn the following morning, and for the next four days our two
Brigades were hotly engaged with the enemy, who were finally
driven back on to Deli Abbas at the foot of the Jebel Hamrin
Range. We bivouacked some ten miles back, and there formed a
line of outposts. Meanwhile the enemy had apparently retired right
up into the hills. On April 8th, our Brigade moved out from
behind the huge mound where we had been under cover and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
marched down to the river Diala, which was some ten miles
distant, to refill our water-carts and let the men do their washing
and have a much-needed dip in the river while the horses were
grazing. After a pleasant day here, during which our patrols saw
no signs of the enemy, we went back to the mound. On the
following morning, the 9th, the Regiment left the Brigade to make
a reconnaissance of Deli Abbas. We had not travelled very far
before we encountered no less than seven columns of the enemy,
who had marched down from the hills during the night. This
force proved to be the 13th Army Corps, some 28,000 strong. The
Regiment immediately took up a position with all Hotchkiss guns,
on a long low mound situated a few miles S.W. of Deli Abbas, and
from here we were able to inflict heavy losses on the enemy, owing
to their eagerness to surround and annihilate what they took to
be an isolated Regiment. In this action Lieutenant Fitz-Gibbon,
although wounded himself, succeeded in getting all our Hotchkiss
guns safely out of action, when we were in danger of envelopment,
and were forced to retire amidst a perfect hail of lead and shell.
Meanwhile the remainder of our Brigade and the 6th Brigade had
deployed for action. Now commenced what proved to be one of
the hardest fights in which the Cavalry had yet been engaged, the
enemy trying their hardest to effect an enveloping movement by
forced marches. This object we were only able to defeat by a
most stubborn ‘rearguard action,’ which we had to maintain until
the arrival of our main force. Our two Brigades engaged them
all day, and by nightfall our outposts were on the Serri, some
eight miles from the mound where we had first come into contact
with the enemy. Early the following morning they renewed the
attack with increased violence, and slowly forced us back the whole
day to the Tomb of &mdash;&mdash;, some few miles north of Deltawa,
where they succeeded in getting well round our left flank, and
were slowly enveloping us, when we received the most welcome
news that our Infantry had arrived, and had succeeded by forced
marches in getting well round the enemy’s right flank, which
considerably relieved the strain from us. Our outposts on this
night, the 11th, were about one mile south of the Tomb. Early
the following morning we, co-operating with our Infantry, made a
very strong attack and succeeded in driving the enemy from their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
position at Chaliyeh, where they left 315 dead on the field after
a very fierce engagement. Renewing the attack at dawn the
following morning, we forced the enemy back again to a small
village called Serai Lik, where they again left the field full of
their dead and wounded: some 200 dead and 900 wounded were
counted. The following morning we again attacked the enemy,
whom we completely routed, and after a very short stand they
speedily retired on to Deli Abbas, a village situated right at the
foot of the Jabel Hamrin range of hills. For two more days we
continued to harass the enemy’s flanks until their main force had
retired right up into the hills again. Our Infantry now formed a
line of outposts some few miles from Deli Abbas, whilst on the
17th inst. the Cavalry marched back to the village of Deltawa,
where we went into bivouac. Here it was decided to form the
Regiment into two composite squadrons, owing to the great number
of casualties we had sustained amongst both men and horses
through wounds, sickness, &amp;c. This was done on the morning of
the 19th inst., and the remaining men and horses were sent into
bivouac at a small village called Sindiyeh, some few miles farther
back. In this district the Arab rifle thieves were very active, and
on several occasions succeeded in getting clear away with rifles,
in spite of the utmost vigilance, during the time we had a bivouac
near that village. During the next fortnight the Regiment remained
in bivouac at Deltawa, at the same time making wide reconnaissances
between the line held by our Infantry, who had ‘dug in’ near the
Serri, and the foot of the Jebel Hamrin Range. During these we
occasionally came into contact with enemy patrols, with whom we
had several sharp skirmishes. It was during one of these that
Private Keany of ‘C’ Squadron was captured while carrying
despatches.</p>

<p>“On May 4th we received orders to march down to Chaldari
and there pitch our summer camp. We accordingly marched to Sa
Salekh and from here to Chaldari, where we proceeded to erect our
summer camp on the left bank of the Tigris some nine miles north
of Baghdad. On the camp being completed, we went into it on the
13th inst., and on the same day the following awards appeared in
our Regimental Orders for gallantry in our action of 9th April:
Lieutenant Fitz-Gibbon the M.C. and Private Roberts the D.C.M.

<p>“Three days after this, the 16th inst., the Regiment received
sudden orders to turn out at 4.30 <small>P.M.</small> on an Arab strafe. It was
made known to us later that these Arabs had literally cut to pieces
the whole of a British survey party, consisting of three British
officers and their orderlies, and some sixteen native soldiers who
were their escort.</p>

<p>“We marched at 4.30 and crossed the river at Baghdad. We
bivouacked that night some ten miles east of it. Marching again
at daybreak, we encountered a terrific sand-storm which made the
going very difficult, nevertheless we succeeded in covering some
thirty-nine miles over the waterless desert before bivouacking for
the night.</p>

<p>“Continuing again early the following morning, we trekked
another eighteen miles or so in the direction of Mushada, when a
halt was made. Reconnoitring from here, we located the Arabs
some distance from the village. We rested until dawn the 19th
inst., when we attacked them and inflicted heavy casualties amongst
them, at the same time driving them before us on to General
Cobbe’s column, which had marched down from Samarrah. This
column exacted a terrible revenge for those murders, and literally
mowed them down with machine-gun fire. We inflicted some 3000
casualties in all amongst this huge band of Bedouin Arabs. This
incident had a wonderful effect on the Arabs throughout the country,
and no doubt prevented them from committing many similar outrages.</p>

<p>“On the conclusion of this we marched back to our camp at
Chaldari.”</p>

<p><i>Private C. T. Massey, ‘D’ Squadron&mdash;March 24.</i>&mdash;“On the 24th we
turned out to graze, and while the horses were grazing Private Cox
came up with the order to ‘turn in and stand to.’ We moved off
in a north-easterly direction about midday, after buying oranges
and limes from Arabs on the square. We rejoined the portion
of the Regiment that moved off earlier in the day, at a camp next
morning, the 25th.</p>

<p>“We were now on the right bank of the river Diala, and I kept
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
no notes of daily events, but we had many severe engagements with
the enemy. It was on Easter Sunday or Monday that we met the
Turkish army coming out of the Jebel Hamrin Range. We were
then at Deli Abbas. It was the 1st and 3rd troops of ‘D’ Squadron
which bore the first shock of the Turkish attack, but we were greatly
outnumbered, and retired only in the nick of time under a hail of
bullets. A few horses came down; one man was killed and two
wounded. My riding-horse got away, so I jumped on top of the
pack-horse, but the gun-case had not been properly strapped up
and the Hotchkiss gun fell out; but No. 5 on the gun, a man named
Cartwright, who was riding behind, dismounted and picked it up,
and I halted and it was put in the case again. We continued to
retreat for several days, but it was part of a clever scheme; the
Infantry meant to get in between them and the hills from which
they came. The Infantry, however, came up too close, and the
Turks retired again, before our Infantry could get behind them, but
they suffered heavy losses in the retreat back to the hills. It was
during these twenty-five days on the Diala that our horses suffered
more than in the whole fighting up from Kut. We could only water
once a day, and many a time I have felt faint from thirst and chewed
grass for moisture, as well as wild oats and barley.”</p>

<p>A few days later the writer was sent on leave to India, and his
diary comes to an end.</p>

<p><i>Letter from 2nd Lieutenant F. Norman Payne&mdash;March 25, 1917.</i>&mdash;“After
the Regiment getting nicely settled down to their garrison
work they were suddenly ordered away, and are now seventy miles
beyond Baghdad.</p>

<p>“Poor chaps may be out weeks and weeks, and already have
been five weeks without any kit, it all still being at Bassouia Camp.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a>

</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dearest Mother</span>,&mdash;No doubt you all thought my last
letter a bit of a hash, which it verily was, but if you only knew
the conditions under which I wrote it you’d think I was lucky to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
get it off as it was. I wrote part of it in Baghdad, as I was in the
City Military Police for a week, and could not manage to post it
then, so I had to take it with me when the order came to get on
the move again. Do you think they could do without the Thirteenth
Hussars here when there’s any dirty work to be done? Not
likely. We got the job as Cavalry garrison in the capital because
we’d distinguished ourselves on the drive-up, and incidentally lost
more than half, but when reinforcements came up and not many
of them, out we had to go again: the Cavalry Division could not
manage without us.</p>

<p>“We’ve been living mainly on fresh air, biscuits, dates, and
water, with an occasional bully or fresh-meat stew when we can
buy or pinch a sheep from Mr Arab. Lor’ knows where we are now,
but we can’t be far from the Russians; in fact, I believe one column
of ours is in communication with them. Our aeroplanes have been
over to ’em several times.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s that. We have had some very exciting little times
since we left B. [Baghdad?], and I thought it was all up when ten
of us, all that’s left of the 4th troop, ‘C’ squadron, had to go out
twelve miles in advance on reconnaissance, as we got cut off by
their Cavalry twice, and had to gallop miles for life and ford a canal,
known as Kelly’s Canal,<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> about eight feet deep. Still we got back
none much the worse.</p>

<p>“Have you ever experienced the thrill one gets when something
happens to lift one out of the blackest depths of depression, &amp;c.?
Well, it was like this, I hadn’t got a fag or shred of baccy, and
hadn’t had a smoke for days; was browned off to the eyebrows
on bully and biscuit diet with occasional spoonful of jam thrown in
here and there&mdash;more then than now&mdash;and was trying to snatch
forty winks&mdash;we were having a rest day&mdash;under my saddle with
flies and mosquitoes buzzing around, sweating like a bull with the
heat of the aft’noon even with one thin shirt on, when a bloke
kicked my feet and shouted, ‘Cheero, Morty, mail’s up.’</p>

<p>“Please keep the newspaper cuttings of all our doings out here.
Now don’t forget that, as I shall love to read ’em over afterwards,
and we don’t get much news of our own doings out here.</p>

<p>“I think I shall manage to wangle the ten-shilling note as soon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
as we get settled somewhere, sometime. Please thank &mdash;&mdash; and &mdash;&mdash; and
all other well-wishers and contributors for me separately
and individually.</p>

<p>“Yes, I received a very nice little parcel from St Silas’s, but
have not had any time at all to acknowledge it, as you can guess by
your mail, which always takes precedence with me.... I expect
we shall be slackening off out here shortly as ’tis getting very hot
again, especially from about 10 <small>A.M.</small> to 4 <small>P.M.</small>, when every effort is an
effort and one sweats rivers, lying down&mdash;in fact, it’s really worse
lying down than knocking slowly, one doesn’t seem to notice the
heat so much then. We have to make bivouacs with our blankets
thrown across swords and twigs stuck in the ground to get a little
shelter from the sun, as there is next to no shadow here, and the
sun is nearly overhead again. Roll on, we’ve just about got J.
Turk beat to the wide now, so it’s about time we had a long rest.
Then we are made to clean and polish everything up, and it’s some
job that, as all steelwork is eaten in with rust, and everything more
or less the same since we came on service.</p>

<p>“Well, my candle has just given me the wink and I’m finishing
this by moonlight, so cheerio to all of you. Hope you are all in
the pink.... Take great care of yourself, mother, love, and all
the others as well. Am fit as a fiddle myself when I can get
enough to eat.”</p>

<p>Private Mortimer was decorated soon afterwards with the Military
Medal for bravery in action, and after reading his letter one is not
surprised to hear it.</p>

<p>The Regiment, it may be observed, though weak in men, and
still weaker in horses, was now strong in officers again. Colonel
Richardson and others wounded at Lajj had returned, and though
one or two more had since been hit, they were doing well. But one,
unhappily, had lost his life in a very sad way: Captain Newton,
who had commanded a squadron at Lajj, and had afterwards gone
through the April fighting, was drowned in the Tigris on the night
of the 25th.</p>

<p>He stepped overboard in the darkness from a river steamer, and
though life-belts were thrown out at once he was swept away by the
current, which was very strong. A boat was lowered, but could find
no trace of him. Captain Newton’s death was much deplored. An
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
officer on the staff of the Division, in a private letter to his own
people, writes of him: “Poor Tiger Newton is dead. He walked
overboard and fell into the Tigris on his way to India on leave....
He is a great loss to the Thirteenth Hussars, where he was immensely
popular. He was a splendid character, was greatly esteemed
by all who came in contact with him, and exercised great influence
in his Regiment.” His Colonel wrote: “Quite apart from my
personal sorrow, I know how grieved the whole Regiment will be,
for both officers and men were very fond of him.” And General
Jones, who had commanded the Brigade at Lajj, wrote of him as
follows: “At the fighting at Lajj, where the Thirteenth Hussars
had such heavy losses, he was the Senior Officer left of the squadrons
in the most advanced line, and was in constant communication with
me by telephone after the charge. It was an anxious time for most of
us, and perhaps especially for me, as I was commanding the Brigade.
Nothing cheered me so much as his cheery voice. We were momentarily
expecting a counter-attack in greatly superior strength, and our
Battery was stricken silent; but he never lost heart, and I am sure
his example went far in putting heart into his men, if such was
necessary. It did me good anyhow. It was also greatly due to him
that at dusk we were able to carry away the officers and men who
were lying wounded between the lines. Had he been alive now, his
name would have gone in for a Mention in Despatches. He died
as many others have died, but he has not lived in vain.”</p>

<p>In other letters mention is made of “his outspoken Christian
life,” and he is described as “one whom everybody loved.”</p>

<p>It may be noted that in the meantime one of the Thirteenth
subalterns, 2nd Lieutenant J. H. Hirsch, had passed through a very
tragic experience, being on board the <i>Cameronian</i> transport, on
the way to join, with several men of the Regiment, when she was
torpedoed in the Mediterranean. His letter describing the affair
shows that “there was no panic,” all the men going quietly to their
posts on deck, and setting to work to lower the boats. The two
destroyers which formed the escort “were simply wonderful&mdash;the
rate they came alongside! When we were hit they dashed round,
making a smoke-screen. Then they dashed round the boats and
rafts and swimmers, like two old hens guarding their young,
picking up men when it was possible, who were shouting for help.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
A lot we passed were drowned, as they had put their life-belts on
wrong....”</p>

<p>Then the submarine was sighted. The writer was by that time
on board one of the destroyers. “The other destroyer had signalled
there was a submarine near us, so the guns were manned, and we
saw the wake of the beast, so we fired and only just missed.”
Luckily the shot was enough to drive away the submarine, otherwise
the slaughter might have been terrible, for, according to
Lieutenant Hirsch, “there were about 1200 men on the destroyer
and about 50 officers,” and she was, of course, exposing herself to
great danger in trying to save life. However, no second torpedo
was fired, and after circling round the wreckage for some hours
after the ship had gone down, the destroyers made for Malta, and
in spite of a “very, very rough” sea, succeeded in getting there
safely next day. But 140 lives were lost, among them the lives
of eight privates of the Thirteenth.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.<br />

<span class="large">THE SUMMER OF 1917.</span></h2>

<p>The summer of 1917 was comparatively quiet; General Maude
writes of it in the following words:&mdash;</p>

<p>“For the remaining five months of the period under review the
heat was considerable, and during the latter part of June, July,
and beginning of August it was intense. Consequently, movements
could not be undertaken by either side without grave risk
of incurring substantial casualties from heat-stroke and heat exhaustion.
The troops enjoyed a well-earned respite from the continuous
fighting in which they had been engaged during the five
months terminating in April, but they were by no means idle. Our
hold over the area was made secure, defensive positions and pivots
were prepared, and training was carried on in the early mornings
and late evenings as the temperature permitted. Manly sports,
too, which are so essential to the wellbeing of the soldier, especially
when temporarily inactive in the military sense, were freely
indulged in, with beneficial results to the health and future fitness
of the army for service in the field. Arrangements had been made
for a proportion of the troops to proceed to India on leave during
the summer months, and those who had been on service for a considerable
time derived much benefit from the change and rest thus
obtained.”</p>

<p>India during the hot-weather months is not usually regarded by
Englishmen as a pleasant country, but no doubt its settled cantonments
and civilised cities were preferable to camp-life in Mesopotamia,
and its cool “hill stations” were a godsend to men worn
out with exposure to the fierce heat of the Arab plains.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span></p>

<p>General Maude’s remark that the troops who remained in Mesopotamia
were “by no means idle” is well within the mark, for not
only were a considerable part of them engaged during the month
of May in such punitive expeditions against the Arabs as the one
mentioned in Chapter XVI., but at some points these expeditions
extended into June and even the beginning of July, when, as he
says, the heat was intense. Nor were such minor movements the
only operations which the troops were called upon to undertake.
In June the Russians reported that in consequence of the increasing
heat they had found it necessary to evacuate the line of the
Diala river, and they withdrew across the Persian border from
which they had advanced. This necessitated the occupation of the
district by a British force, and in August this force had to drive
back a body of Turkish troops. Moreover, in July it was thought
necessary to push a column forward on the line of the Euphrates,
and there was some fighting with the Turks in this direction, fighting
which was stopped only by “a blinding dust-storm” and “the
commencement of an abnormal heat-wave.” On both flanks of the
army, therefore, the troops had active work to do in the summer
months.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the bulk of the British troops about Baghdad did
no doubt enjoy a peaceful summer in their standing camps along
the banks of the Tigris; and this was the case with the Thirteenth,
who were left undisturbed among the palm groves at Chaldari. There
they rested and recruited their strength for any further campaigning
that might occur when the summer was over. Before that
time arrived the regiment was thoroughly fit for service again&mdash;its
numbers full, in officers, men, and horses, and its health
excellent.</p>

<p>The following brief extracts from letters and diaries seem to be
all that is available for this peaceful interlude in their Mesopotamian
war record.</p>

<p><i>Captain S. O. Robinson&mdash;May 13, 1917.</i>&mdash;“It is too hot to fight
out here now, and we are sitting down for the hot weather after a
very successful winter campaign. I expect people at home look
upon this as a side-show, which of course it is compared with
Europe, but all the same there has been plenty of hard fighting,
under most difficult and trying conditions.</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="caption small">CHALDARI CAMP. 1917</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span></p>

<p>“Those at the top, responsible for running the show, have run
it very well indeed.</p>

<p>“I have not had any letters from any of you for weeks, but
expect letters will turn up eventually; the advance was so rapid
that they are bound to have gone wrong.”</p>

<p><i>2nd Lieutenant Guy Pedder&mdash;June 7.</i>&mdash;“Just been told I may go
on the next leave to India; if so, I shall sail from Basra on the
18th, and will probably go up to Mussoori or some hill station....</p>

<p>“Our routine at present is: 5.30-7, training remounts; 7-8,
stables, and nothing else all day but lie in a tent and get bored,
so I shall be very pleased to get away. It’s not really hot yet, but
quite hot enough to stay in a tent all day. Absolutely no news....
Well, cheerio, <span class="smcap">Guy</span>. No letter from you for three weeks.”</p>

<p>2nd Lieutenant Pedder had returned shortly before from hospital,
on recovery from his wound received at Lajj.</p>

<p><i>2nd Lieutenant F. N. Payne&mdash;July.</i>&mdash;“The Cavalry have a splendid
camp all along the river. They have an ice-barge, cinema, ice-cream
shop with many coloured drinks, polo, bathing, and fishing, so
that it is ten per cent cooler than in Baghdad. They can dress
as they please, and are pretty comfortable.</p>

<p>“Most of the officers have had mud walls built round their
roomy tents.”</p>

<p>A pleasant picture, and a contrast to the earlier phases of the
Mesopotamian War, when our ill-equipped and out-numbered troops
were struggling with all the initial difficulties and hardships, or
vainly throwing away their lives in desperate assaults on the Turkish
trenches to relieve Kut.</p>

<p><i>2nd Lieutenant Pedder&mdash;August 28.</i>&mdash;“Here I am back again and
very fit. Most of the people here are very fed up. They had one
very hot spell, otherwise the heat hasn’t been too bad, and they
have got plenty of ice and soda, &amp;c. It is still pretty warm, but
much pleasanter than Basra or being on the river coming up....</p>

<p>“Robinson lent me a very good book the other day, ‘In Mesopotamia,’
by Martin Swayne.</p>

<p>“We are giving a concert to-night, and each mess has got at
least three guests.</p>

<p>“In a week’s time the Division is holding a race-meeting.
I am not riding, as I have had no time to train my horses....
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span></p>

<p>“A week after our meeting there’s to be a huge regatta at
Baghdad, and then I suppose war, at least I certainly hope not
before then.”</p>

<p><i>September 4.</i>&mdash;“Many thanks for your letter, dated July 8th,
which arrived a week ago. We won’t get another mail for another
week, when we expect the Colonel, who arrived Basra on the 1st.</p>

<p>“Hurrah, it’s getting cooler. However, when it gets cool
we’ll move, and I don’t know which is preferable&mdash;heat and peace,
or pleasant climate and fighting: I wouldn’t vote for either.</p>

<p>“I got back just in time for the Cavalry Division Race Meeting,
but not early enough to train ‘Matches’ for the Lajj Cup. The meeting
was a great success. The Regiment did awfully well&mdash;won three
events out of six. Ormrod won the big event, Baghdad Cup given by
Maude; Hartigan won the Kut Cup, and was second in the Lajj Cup;
and Peat, who is now my servant and was Eve’s, won the Br.
Ranks open, a very fine performance, as there were forty-two
starters, and it was a flat six furlongs. Our Brigade showed its
superiority by winning every event.</p>

<p>“They are starting a great Sporting Club at Baghdad with its
grounds 1&frac12; miles outside, where there will be golf, tennis, cricket,
racing (?), polo, and boating. It’s a great scheme, and will be a
godsend if we are stuck here after cessation of hostilities.</p>

<p>“Did you see the Colonel has got D.S.O. now as well as Croix
de Guerre, also FitzGibbon has got M.C. as well as Italian Medal?</p>

<p>“I go out shooting occasionally, but there’s not much.... It’s
still too hot to go out or do anything before 5; however, it’s not
as unbearable as it was.”</p>

<p><i>Captain S. O. Robinson&mdash;September 10.</i>&mdash;“It is still very hot here
in the middle of the day, and when you do get any wind it is
generally accompanied with dust.</p>

<p>“We are expecting a large draft of men this week, and shall be
very glad to get them, as we are very short at present.”</p>

<p><i>September 18.</i>&mdash;“We have had a dust-storm for the last three
days, which is very unpleasant, but the wind usually drops at
night. I am writing this in a mud hut, so am out of it for the
time being.</p>

<p>“The British army is more or less settling down in the occupied
portion of this country. I only hope we shan’t get a rude shock.</p>

Bowie, continued from the extract in Chapter XVI.</p>

<p>“On the conclusion of this<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> we marched back to our camp at
Chaldari, and here commenced our summer routine and the training
of remounts, and drafts of men from England for the next
operations.</p>

<p>“On the 31st May the Cavalry Brigades were inspected by
Lieut.-General Sir Stanley Maude, who, after making us a very
stirring speech congratulating us on the splendid work we had
done during the advance on Baghdad, presented the awards which

<p>“On 16th August we held a boxing competition at Chaldari
for the Cavalry, the most notable event being the fight between
Private Wells, Thirteenth Hussars, <i>versus</i> Private Harriss, Fourteenth
Hussars, when Wells added greatly to his reputation by gaining the
verdict over Harriss, who was at one time the Bantam Champion
of India.</p>

<p>“Some little time after this, the Regiment was invited by the
Sheikh of a neighbouring Arab village to beat up his estate for wild
boar. This we accepted, and all ranks had a most enjoyable day’s
sport in consequence.</p>

<p>“It was during our stay here that the first Baghdad Racing
Meeting was held. It was on September 1st, and this proved a
great day for us, some of our own horses winning some most
exciting races. Six races there were, numerous entries, big fields,
and a band to enliven the proceedings. There were twenty runners
for the Kut Cup, which was won by ‘Whiskers,’ belonging to
Lieutenant Ormrod, and ridden by Lieutenant Hartigan, both of
the Thirteenth Hussars, and almost as many for the Baghdad Cup,
a two-mile steeple-chase, which was won by ‘Venus,’ owned and
ridden by Lieutenant Ormrod. For the Lajj Cup another big field
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
turned out; this was won by ‘Flying Heckle,’ owned by Major
Daniels, and there were more than a score of runners for the Deli
Abbas Cup. This was won by ‘Percival,’ a horse owned and
ridden by Lieutenant Denning. Dearly, indeed, are these cups
prized by their fortunate possessors, who were presented with them
by Lieutenant-General Sir Stanley Maude at the conclusion of the
day’s sport.</p>

<p>“Shortly after this, on September 10th, we held our first
Baghdad Regatta. This was a very small affair, but contained
many popular events, such as pontoon races, launch races, gufa
races, dinghy races, and tilting competitions. One race in particular
which we were very proud to carry off was the gufa race. In
this we gained both first and second place, beating all other competitors
by several hundred yards. It should be here explained
that a gufa is nothing more or less than a large circular basket
about 3 feet in depth and 8 feet in diameter, covered with skin.
This race was really the tit-bit of the day’s sport, much amusement
being caused by our frantic efforts to propel such an unwieldy craft
on such a river as the Tigris.”</p>

<p>So ends Lance-Corporal Bowie’s diary for the summer. It
must be admitted that if the Thirteenth had shown themselves
forward in action they were not behindhand in sport. The two
things do not perhaps always go together, but it is remarkable how
often they do.</p>

<span class="large">AUTUMN OF 1917&mdash;RAMADIE, MENDALI, TEKRIT.</span></h2>

<p>When the summer of 1917 drew towards an end, and the weather
began to grow more suitable for action in the field, General Maude
had worked out his scheme for further operations, and was ready
to move.</p>

<p>His force was now facing due north, towards the distant Turkish
base in Asia Minor, and it was evident that this must be the main
line of warfare during the ensuing winter&mdash;the line of the Tigris
still, but the Upper Tigris as it comes down from the Northern
Highlands. For the moment, however, the Turks on this line were
giving no trouble. Hard hit by the fighting in April, they had
remained for some months content to hold the river down to Tekrit,
more than a hundred miles above Baghdad; and before committing
himself to an advance upon this position, which was strong and well
prepared for defence, General Maude decided to secure both his flanks
so as to be quite free from trouble when delivering his main blow.</p>

<p>Facing his left, on the Euphrates, the enemy had a considerable
body of troops at Ramadie, a few miles beyond the British advanced
posts; and on his extreme right the Turkish 13th Corps,
falling back before the Russians from Persia, but not closely
pressed, seemed inclined to assume a threatening attitude. In
September he struck simultaneously in both directions.</p>

<p>On the Euphrates a considerable force of Infantry with one of
his Cavalry Brigades, including the Fourteenth Hussars, advanced
on Ramadie and carried out a very successful attack. The end of
it was that the Turkish force was not only beaten but completely
surrounded, the Cavalry getting round into their rear and cutting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
their line of retreat. In these circumstances they were forced to
surrender, and more than three thousand prisoners fell into General
Maude’s hands.</p>

<p>At the same time another force, with the Cavalry Brigade to
which the Thirteenth belonged, pushed out eastward and seized
Mendali, close to the Persian border. They made no large capture
there, for the enemy did not attempt to hold it, but they drove him
off and established themselves right up to Persian territory.</p>

<p>It will be seen from the map on page 201 that in this part of
the country, to the north-east of Baghdad, a range of hills, the
Jebel Hamrin, cuts across the district lying between the Tigris and
the Diala rivers, and even extends beyond the Diala southward.
This range, a mass of difficult highlands, was held by the Turks,
and was a formidable obstacle to any advance against them, while
from its lower spurs issued a great system of canals upon which
depended the fertile tracts below. To complete the expulsion of
the Turks from these tracts, rich in supplies, and to prepare for a
further advance in the future, General Maude’s right-hand force
now pushed on and seized the head works of the canals, penetrating
some way into the Jebel Hamrin. There they established
themselves, opening up the country with great labour by bridging
the canals and making roads. General Marshall, who commanded
the force, writes that “seventy-five bridges of various
sizes were built in this area alone, and the Jebel Hamrin, which
prior to our occupation was a roadless tangle of hills, was gradually
pierced by a very complete and convenient number of roads
suitable for wheeled traffic.”<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a></p>

<p>Thus both on the Euphrates and on the Diala, to left and right,
General Maude had freed himself from immediate enemy pressure.
It remained to deal with the Turks to the north on the Tigris.</p>

<p>These, consisting of his old enemy the 18th Corps, greatly reinforced,
had not been passive spectators of the British movements
on the two flanks. They did not move in time to prevent or
hamper these movements, but in the middle of October 1917 they
pushed down the Tigris for a considerable distance below their
strong intrenched position at Tekrit, and assumed a threatening
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
attitude. General Maude at once struck at them in front, and
bringing in the Cavalry from his wings, tried at the same time to
work round their flanks, the result being that they retired again to
Tekrit, and there gave battle. It was a strong position&mdash;“an
intricate system of trenches, many of which had been well and
deeply dug, with numerous machine-gun emplacements”; and, as
every one knows, the Turks in such a position are among the most
tenacious soldiers in the world.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, on the 5th of November they were attacked and
completely defeated, losing 2000 men, of whom 300 were killed
and though the brunt of the trench-fighting fell of course upon the
Infantry, the Cavalry did their share. General Marshall, who was
in immediate command, records that in the afternoon “a spirited
attack by the Infantry coupled with a charge by the Cavalry
Brigade on the flank, threw back the Turks in disorder, who fled
panic-stricken.” Most of them got away under cover of strong
rearguard positions, prepared beforehand, which held up the
British pursuit. Still, it was a very successful action, and during
the night the Turks, after burning a large quantity of ammunition
and stores, withdrew the whole of their forces to a point forty
miles up the river.</p>

<p>At Tekrit, for the second time in the Mesopotamian campaign,
the Thirteenth, or two squadrons of them, got an opportunity of
attacking on horseback, sword in hand, which is always the chance
the Cavalry soldier longs to get. They lost an excellent officer,
Captain Robinson, who was commanding the two squadrons concerned,
and was killed in the charge. Another officer, Lieutenant
Williams-Taylor, was wounded and taken prisoner. Their total
loss was six killed and twenty-two wounded&mdash;only a fourth of the
loss sustained at Lajj eight months before, but still a sensible one
for two weak squadrons. It was a fine affair, and the Regiment
was proud of itself.</p>

<p>After the action, and the rapid retreat of the Turks, the main
portion of the troops on this line were brought back to a better
position, but Tekrit was held and was never again in Turkish
hands.</p>

<p>Unhappily, this was the last battle fought by the army of
Mesopotamia while under the command of General Maude. On
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
the 18th of November, at the height of his success and reputation,
he died of cholera in Baghdad, and not only for the troops he had
led to victory, but for the nation, his death was a real misfortune.
Few men have been more beloved by those who served under
him, or more trusted as a bold and yet careful commander. He
was no doubt more fortunate than his predecessors, in that he
was given a large and thoroughly equipped force to do the work
demanded of him, while they had been called upon to achieve
victory with troops insufficient in number and very badly equipped,
but this in no way detracts from his merits. He was not like them,
asked to do impossibilities, but what he was asked to do was not
easy, and he did it thoroughly well.</p>

<p>The following extracts are from papers bearing upon the fight
at Tekrit from the point of view of the Thirteenth Hussars.</p>

<p class="author">
“<span class="smcap">Tekrit</span>, <i>November 5th, 1917</i>.</p>

<p>“In the afternoon we advanced under fairly heavy shell-fire, but
with few casualties, and dismounted in a depression of the ground
about half a mile from the Turkish position. There was plenty of
firing, but we were under good cover. The Infantry were attacking
on our right nearer the river and town of Tekrit. At first we
were ordered to attack dismounted, and had just prepared to do
so when the order was countermanded.</p>

<p>“We sat about smoking and watching the progress of the fight
to our right and half right. Then ‘B’ Squadron was ordered to
mount. Robinson told me he had orders to go in with the sword.
We formed up under cover, the composition of the squadron being
roughly as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Three troops (2nd, 3rd, and 4th) less the Hotchkiss guns and gunners
not armed with the sword.</p>

<table>

    <td>Captain Robinson</td>
    <td>Squadron leader.</td>

    <td>Third troop.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>and myself</td>

  </tr></table>

<p>“The total strength could not have been more than forty swords
(this total I have arrived at after discussing it with Sergeant-Major
Potter, who was then S.S.M. of ‘B’ Squadron).
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span></p>

<p>“We trotted out in squadron column, and soon came under heavy
but inaccurate rifle and M.G. fire. We then formed line and
extended. It was impossible to see what was going on in front
owing to the smoke and dust. Captain Robinson brought the
squadron to a walk, while Alston and I went out to see what was
in front of us. We had only to gallop a short way to see the
enemy position. It looked formidable with well-made trenches
and machine-guns, and more Turks than we could count. We also
saw our own Infantry to our right. I reported to Robinson, who
galloped off half left to see what was going on there. He soon
disappeared into the dust. Our position was now unpleasant,
advancing at a walk over perfectly flat ground under heavy and
increasing fire from rifles, machine-guns, and guns, so I brought
the right shoulders up until we were following Robinson’s line,
and gave the order to charge. This was the last I saw of the
squadron, as I was a considerable distance in front trying to keep
in touch with the squadron leader.</p>

<p>“I crossed the front-line trench and found that the Turks were
very demoralised, and I could not get near any of them. I then
went on and crossed another trench (a communication trench) and
had a go at a Turk who was half in and half out of the trench.
He was very low down, and my horse jumped, so though I got him
I don’t suppose it killed him. I found Robinson surrounded by
some thirty or forty Turks. They apparently had been paralysed
with fear, which was now working off when they saw only two of
us. Robinson turned his horse and galloped at them, but was shot
down point-blank. I followed him when he started to gallop, but
my horse was shot and came down (just by Robinson, who died
almost instantly), pinning me down underneath him. We exchanged
shots with each other for some time at a range of about
five yards, and I got a bullet through the shoulder, and shortly
afterwards a clout on the back of the head from a rifle-butt, and
some minor injuries.</p>

<p>“I was unconscious for a time, and came to, to find the Turks
looting me. They got my pistol, glasses, &amp;c., when a Turkish
officer came running up firing his revolver off in the air and shouting
at them. They departed into the trench under a shower of
what I suppose was abuse from the officer, who was now firing at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
them, but did not seem to hit anybody. The Turk then came up
to me and asked in bad French if I was an officer. He then made
me a long speech, and told me he was a captain most distinguished
of the M.G. Corps, and that he was pleased to meet me, and
that he was a Socialist from Constantinople, &amp;c., &amp;c. I thanked
him and told him I was glad to meet him, and that I was also
very distinguished, but would be able to chat better if he took my
dead horse off me, which he did under a very heavy fire from our
people. He was very good indeed, and had my various damages
seen to there and then in the trench. He subsequently took me
back to the Turkish C.O. of the Regiment, where I had coffee and
cigarettes before going on to the Field Ambulance. I found out
that there were some four thousand Turks at the point where
we charged.”</p>

<p>“On September 25th we marched out to commence operations
again, our first march being to Conningham Post, some 12
miles distant. The next day we marched on to Baquba. Here
we took the opportunity of giving our horses a good swim in the
Diali river, which runs by the side of the village. Early the
following morning we moved on to Belad-Rus and after resting
here for a few hours we made a night march at about 8.30 <small>P.M.</small> on
to Mandali, a village situated right at the foot of the Jabel
Hamrin hills. This place we attacked at dawn, and speedily
discovered that it was held by a very small force of Turkish
Cavalry, about one squadron, who, needless to say, did not waste
any time with us, but took to their heels and succeeded in
escaping through the pass into Persia, where, as we discovered
later, they fell into the hands of the Kurds, those very fierce tribesmen
who never lose an opportunity of revenging themselves for
former outrages they have suffered at the hands of the Turks.
Our chief capture here was some 300 camels, which are the enemy’s
chief means of transport in this country.</p>

<p>“We went into bivouac near this village and remained there for
about 14 days, while at the same time we made daily reconnaissances
well into the surrounding country. During this period
we were forced to live on the country, our transport failing to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
arrive with our much-needed rations for some unaccountable reason,
and our fare consisted mainly of dates and oranges, which, fortunately
for us, were very plentiful in that district. Even our
horses had to be rationed with these dates.</p>

<p>“On October 18th we left Mandali and made a forced march on
to Kizil-Robart, making a short halt at the Salt Water Lake in
the Jabel Hamrin hills, some 23 miles distant, to refresh our
horses; we marched again at dawn and covered another 17
miles at a very fast pace. We came into contact with the enemy
a few miles south of the village. We at once deployed for action
and engaged them, and at the conclusion of a very severe day’s
fighting we had driven them back on to the village. Renewing our
attack early the following morning, we succeeded in driving them
out of it, and finally captured the village at about 11.45 <small>A.M.</small> on the
20th instant. Leaving our Infantry to occupy this place, the following
three days we devoted to reconnoitring the surrounding country.</p>

<p>“On the 23rd instant the following names appeared in our Regimental
Orders for conspicuous gallantry in our action at Lajj on
March 5th: S.S.M. Brearly, Cpl. Bowie, L.-Cpl. Stevens, L.-Cpl.
Watkins, and S.S. Couch. All were awarded the D.C.M., and a
very proud Regiment we were on this day.</p>

<p>“The following morning we left bivouac and marched through
the pass, leading our horses owing to the very rough nature of the
ground. Mounting at the farther end we marched on to Sharaban,
where we bivouacked for the night. The following day we moved
off to Baquba, where we arrived at about 4 <small>P.M.</small> It was whilst
here that we celebrated the anniversary of the Balaclava Charge,
in which the Regiment took part. Making an early start the next
morning, we marched on to Sadiyah. Crossing the river Tigris
at midday, we bivouacked at a spot which afterwards proved to be
the site of our winter camp. We were not destined to rest here
very long, however, as two days later we were ordered out to take
part in some operations on this side of the river. We marched
out on the 29th instant, and bivouacked at Sinajah some 15
miles distant. From this place all our movements had to be made
under cover of darkness. Marching again on the night of the 30th,
we rested at Istabulat, from which we made another night march
on to Samarrah, arriving there at about 10 <small>A.M.</small> on November 1st.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
Here we rested until 8 <small>P.M.</small>, when we marched again to a point
some 12 miles west of Daur. We waited here until dawn, when
we commenced an elaborate demonstration, whilst our Infantry
were attacking Daur from the south. During this day we came
under a considerable amount of shell-fire, and here the Regiment
was subjected to a very severe test, while our Colonel displayed
the utmost coolness and courage in manœuvring us at the walk
in the very face of the enemy’s Artillery, in order to draw their
fire and thereby enable our observers to locate their batteries.</p>

<p>“Our casualties during the demonstration amounted to 1 killed<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a>
and 5 wounded, whilst later on the same evening an enemy airman
tried hard to inflict further casualties amongst us by bombing,
but fortunately without success.</p>

<p>“On reaching bivouac that night we received the stimulating news
that our Infantry, under General Cobb, had succeeded in capturing
Daur; after attacking a strong trench system of a 9-mile perimetre
encircling Tekrit, they had defeated the Turks after heavy
fighting, capturing some 319 prisoners and the river boat <i>Julnar</i>,
which was aground near by. This steamer was captured from us
by the Turks in our attempt to reach Kut with provisions for General
Townshend and his heroic force in April 1915.</p>

<p>“The following day, November 3rd, whilst resting in bivouac, we
were again bombed by the enemy airmen, but, luckily for us, the
majority of our horses were being watered at the river at the time,
and this undoubtedly saved us from a stampede, our casualties this
time being 10 of our transport mules which were killed outright,
and one man slightly wounded.</p>

<p>“On the night of the 4th we again moved up, marching on to
Tekrit, which is on the river, some 5 miles north of Daur. Here
the Turks had installed themselves in a very strong position. Whilst
‘standing to’ at dawn awaiting the order to attack, we were once
more bombed by enemy airmen, but luckily without result. A short
time after this we commenced our attack against the enemy’s right
flank, whilst our Infantry engaged them frontally. We fought
our way by a succession of bounds up to a large hollow, which
afforded us excellent cover, and was situated some 1500 yards
from the enemy’s main position. Having a short breather here to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
refresh both man and horse, we suddenly received the order to
mount, and galloping over the top we, under a splendid moving
curtain of fire from our Artillery, drew our swords and charged
straight into the enemy’s trenches, passing through our own Infantry
on the way, who cheered us madly. We took their first and penetrated
into their second line of defences, where we dispersed a considerable
number of their reinforcements who were being massed
for a counter-attack, inflicting on them heavy losses. An incident
which enraged us beyond measure was the tactics which the Turks
resorted to on this and previous occasions when we had attacked
them in a similar manner. Immediately on us charging their front
line, they would throw down their arms and cry for quarter, which
on us lifting our swords and granting, thus leaving them to surrender
to our supports while we charged on to their second line,
they would deliberately regain their rifles and fire into our backs.
On realising this treachery again, we wheeled about and literally
cut our way through this treacherous mass, and it is thought that
any who may have escaped our avenging swords were brought
down by our Hotchkiss gunners, who maintained a steady fire on
our left flank throughout the action.</p>

<p>“On regaining the deep nullah from which we commenced our
charge, the roll was called and it was found that our total casualties
were 6 killed and 22 wounded. Amongst the killed was one
of our most popular officers, Captain S. O. Robinson, the leader of
‘B’ Squadron, whilst Lt. Williams-Taylor, being wounded, was
captured, together with Pte. Kasper of ‘C’ Squadron.</p>

<p>“Having secured sufficient horses from the native Regiments to
replace our heavy casualties, we rejoined the 6th Brigade and
bivouacked some 10 miles back on the right bank of the river,
which we were more than glad to sight again, men and horses
having fought and worked for over 70 hours on the desert without
any fresh water. We had a well-earned rest here the following
day, and we received many congratulations from various Corps and
Divisional commanders for the work we had done and its moral
effect on the enemy. We commenced our march back to Sadiyah
on the morning of the 7th instant, doing easy marches owing to the
exhausted condition of our horses. We arrived at Sadiyah at noon
on the 12th instant, whilst on the 18th the following names appeared
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
in our Regimental Orders for gallantry in our last engagement:
Lts. Norton and Jones both winning the M.C., Sgt. Tetheridge the
D.C.M., whilst Sgt. Matthews, Pte. Corbyn, and Pte. Mortimer all
won the M.M.”</p>

<p>“We are out on operations again now, as I expect you will have
seen; a good show has been managed, and Johnny Turk is not
feeling too well just now. We have practically wiped out one of
their divisions, and how he is going to do anything more in this

<p class="caption"><i>Operations leading up to the battle and capture of Tekrit, November 1917.</i><br />
<i>By Colonel J. J. Richardson.</i></p>

<p>“After continuous trekking since the 17th October, including the
enveloping manœuvres, which resulted in the evacuation by the
Turks of the Jeb-el-Hamrin on the left bank of the Diala river, and
of Kizil Robart, we reached Sadiyah on the Tigris on Friday, October
26th, and encamped on the right bank about a mile from the
remainder of the Division. Owing to smallpox&mdash;contracted by men
who had been assisting the L.P.O. at Mandali&mdash;having broken out
in the Brigade, we were segregated, and we were looking forward
to a well-earned and much-needed rest, to making up our equipment
and to getting our winter clothing.</p>

<p>“But on Sunday the 28th we received orders to proceed by night
marches to Samarra. We were joined by the Division at Istabulat
on the 31st, and marched that night for Samarra and bivouacked for
the day in the old Izakhi Canal.</p>

<p>“On the night of the 1st-2nd November we marched to a
position west of Daur, co-operating with the 7th Division in
driving the enemy out of this place, and bivouacked that night
at Daur.</p>

<p>“Daur is a very strong natural position, being protected by the
broken and undulating ground rising to the plateau some 50 feet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
high to the westward, and having, owing to the same ground, a
covered way of retreat to Tekrit, some ten miles to the north.</p>

<p>“At 7 <small>A.M.</small> on the morning of the 3rd the Division marched out
to reconnoitre Aujah-Tekrit, and came under artillery fire at the
former place; the 7th Brigade continued its march to carry out its
task of testing the strength in which the trenches to the west and
north-west were held by the enemy, and drew sufficient fire to
enable the G.O.C. to report them held in strength. The Regiment
suffered some seven casualties, of which one proved fatal, from
shell-fire. We returned to bivouac at Daur that evening, reaching
camp about 7.30 <small>P.M.</small></p>

<p>“On the night of the 4th-5th the Division made a night march to
a position west of Tekrit to co-operate on the 5th with the Infantry
in their assault at that place.</p>

<p>“The Brigade was detailed to work close on the left flank of the
Infantry, and the Regiment was held in reserve all day. This gave
us an opportunity of watching from a good point of vantage the
systematic advances of the Infantry behind an intense artillery
barrage, and it was good to see them (in this case Punjabi Infantry)
advancing shoulder to shoulder, slowly and deliberately, to the
assault. What most struck me as a spectator was the apparent
immunity from casualties of this system, although next day we
learnt that they had had their fair share of casualties.</p>

<p>“The two native Cavalry Regiments of the Brigade&mdash;with the
exception of two squadrons&mdash;had been operating on foot against the
trenches to the west of Tekrit, and the 6th Brigade had been acting
as a flank-guard some way to the north and north-west, and by its
presence there had prevented an enemy Division, which had been
marching presumably from Khanal Kharninah, from joining hands
with the force holding the Tekrit position.</p>

<p>“About 4.45 <small>P.M.</small> General Norton decided that the time had come
when we could materially assist the Infantry, and ordered me to
send a squadron mounted to find the enemy first-line trench at a
point about 1&frac12; miles to the north-west of Imam Arbain, which was
almost the only conspicuous landmark, and from there to sweep
right-handed up the trench towards the left flank of our Infantry,
who appeared to be assaulting the trenches between them and the
Imam, from a south-westerly direction. I accordingly ordered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
Captain Robinson to take his Squadron (‘B’) for this duty, and
Lieutenant Norton to hold his Squadron (‘C’) in readiness to
support ‘B.’ When ‘B’ was well under way, ‘C’ Squadron was
ordered out, and soon afterwards the Brigadier ordered me to take
out the two remaining Squadrons in support. This I did, ‘D’
Squadron leading, and as we approached the trench line swords
were drawn. I had meantime lost sight in the dust, and in the
failing light, of the two leading squadrons, but saw about 100 or 150
men on foot on some rising ground, whom I took to be Turks who
had held up their hands to the two leading squadrons, and I turned
towards them, intending to round them up and prevent them from
taking up their rifles again, as our experience at Lajj taught me
they were apt to do. As I drew nearer, however, I saw they were our
own Infantry, and seeing a British officer I rode up to him and
asked him the situation.</p>

<p>“He told me that the two squadrons had gone on to our left
front, and that there was a party of about 50 or 100 Turks
some 200 yards straight ahead. I decided to go for these, and
we passed a squadron of Indian Cavalry (13th Lancers) on our
left as we advanced at a slow gallop with our left on a communication
trench running much in the same direction I was
pursuing. A good deal of rifle fire was being poured into us, and,
from the sound of it at very close range, probably from the communication
trench, but personally I saw no body of Turks nearer
than 1000 yards.</p>

<p>“Meanwhile we had crossed some three lines of fire trenches in
which a few wounded Turks were lying, and on my left I saw
the two leading squadrons returning from their ride. They were
then about 400 yards away, and the light had become so bad
that I distinctly saw the flashes from the enemy artillery some
2000 yards ahead of us. I had already gone far beyond the
objective given us by the Brigadier, and now that I had found the
two leading squadrons, I was chiefly concerned in getting the
Regiment out of action whilst the light remained. I accordingly
had ‘Rally to the Right’ sounded on the trumpet, in the hope of
drawing ‘B’ and ‘C’ Squadrons to me, but they were too far off
to hear the sound in the din of the firing, so I wheeled to the right
again and returned to the neighbourhood of the first-line trench.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
I was then in rear of the squadrons, and seeing a few men
struggling back with wounded comrades and wounded horses, I sent
out a message to Major Twist to retire the horses out of range, then
to dismount the men and bring them up dismounted to cover the
retirement of any stragglers who had been wounded or unhorsed.
I myself stayed with the R.S.M. (Seekins), the Trumpet-Major, and
a few men to give a hand to a few men who had got left with
wounded comrades and horses.</p>

<p>“After allowing about half an hour for any stragglers to rejoin, I
retired the men on to their horses and we rejoined the Brigade.
Here I learned that Captain Robinson had been killed, Lieutenant
Williams-Taylor and some seven N.C.O.’s and men were missing.
‘C’ Squadron had 22 horses killed and ‘B’ 9; in addition, we
had about 19 men wounded; my orderly was hit in the chin, and
his horse through the neck. One man, Pte. Thomson, died of
wounds <i>en route</i> to bivouac at Aujah Nullah, which we reached
about midnight.</p>

<p>“Here I will interpose an account of the doings of ‘B’ and
‘C’ Squadrons, as gathered from reports by officers and
men.</p>

<p>“‘B’ Squadron rode straight to the point to which they were
directed without opposition, and Captain Robinson, finding our
Infantry in position, there halted and waited until ‘C’ Squadron
came up; then he explained the situation to Lieutenant Norton,
and his decision to lead the two squadrons against a mass of
Turks, 300 to 400 in number (estimated), who could be seen some
1000 or 1200 yards away to his left and left front,&mdash;and I may say
here in parenthesis, that his decision to go beyond the objective
given by the Brigadier was eminently the right one, if not the
only one: our mission was to assist the Infantry, and that was
the only way in which he could do it under the altered circumstances,
so the two squadrons wheeled to the left and rode to the
north-west, one on either side of a long&mdash;and I think the first-line&mdash;trench.
They went through the Turks, and in this advance
Captain Robinson was killed, shot through the head by one of the
four Turks whom he was trying to take on with his sword. His
Trumpeter, Maguire, claims to have shot this particular Turk with
his revolver. Having gone through the mass of the Turks, they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
turned about 1200 or 1500 yards from where they started,
and rode through the Turks again, and they claim to have
accounted for at least a man per man. It was soon after this
that I saw them returning, and they pulled up near our Infantry
and came under Major Twist’s orders. The men were much elated
with their ‘ride,’ and our losses were, comparatively speaking,
extremely light, as the rifle and machine-gun fire was very
heavy, and as they returned, they came under fire from two
or three batteries&mdash;at a low estimate. At one time when I was
looking, I saw the sky thick with bursting shrapnel, but it was all
very high, and the gunners must have been firing wildly. It must
be remembered, too, that by this time the dusk was becoming
the dark.</p>

<p>“Next day, the 6th November, we learnt that the Turks had
completely evacuated Tekrit during the night, so I sent an officer’s
patrol, under Lieutenant Stirling, to go over the battlefield and to
gather what information they could about our dead and wounded.
On its return I learnt that our Infantry had buried six dead, presumably
belonging to the Regiment, although they could not be
identified, as the Turks had stripped them completely, even to
their identity discs; so on the following day, the 7th, I obtained
permission to take a party for the purpose of burying all our men
together, and succeeded in getting the Divisional Padre&mdash;Ryan&mdash;to
accompany it. We only succeeded in finding four bodies&mdash;viz.,
those of Captain Robinson, Sergeants Gray and Newman, and
Private Francomb, and these we collected and buried, and the
Padre read the burial service over them. We also found Lieutenant
Williams-Taylor’s horse, dead, where it fell, and from its
position, and from the report of the man who saw him lying
under it, pinned by its weight to the ground, I felt confident in
assuming that he had been taken prisoner by the Turks.</p>

<p><i>Note added on 6th February 1918.</i>&mdash;“This assumption has been confirmed
by wire received to-day from London, and I have every
hope of hearing soon that S.S.M. Tegg is also alive, but a prisoner
of war.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Extract from letter from Lieut.-Colonel J. J. Richardson to General
Symons, C.M.G., dated 7th Cavalry Brigade, M.E.F., November
9, 1917.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Symons</span>,&mdash;Altho’ this letter may seem to you to be rather
belated you must make allowances, for we have been on trek ‘on
operation scale’ continually since the 17th of last month.... By
great good fortune we bivouacked at Baghdad on Balaclava Day, and
I was able to get (from the E.F. canteen) a bottle of beer a man
and &frac12; a bottle of ‘pop’ per officer.</p>

<p>“We have just completed, and are returning to our base from,
the operations against Tekrit, where the Rgt. again distinguished
itself in a mounted charge against the Turks entrenched, and
enabled the complete capture of the strong position to be consummated
before nightfall. Our losses, altho’ they include the loss of
Bob Robinson (killed), were extraordinarily&mdash;and to me unaccountably&mdash;light,
being 1 officer and 5 O.R. killed, 1 officer and 2 O.R.
missing, and 16 O.R. wounded. The missing include Williams-Taylor
and S.S.M. Tegg, but I have very great hopes that the former
and possibly the latter will prove to be prisoners of war. Two days
later I was able to collect and bury together and hold a service
over the corpses of Robinson, Sgts. Gray and Newman, and Pte.
Francomb. We claim to have accounted for at least 100 Turks,
and Sgt. Gray’s sword was thick with blood up to the hilt.</p>

<p>“Please let General B.P. and as many present and past 13ths
know this, and that I feel confident they will hear nothing but good
of the Rgt. The men were simply splendid, and <i>ipso facto</i> the
officers also.&mdash;Yours sincerely,</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir Frederick</span>,&mdash;Many thanks for your kind letter
of August 27th, which has been forwarded to me from home, and
reached me last night; many thanks also for your kind offer to help
financially in the publication of the record of the Regiment in this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
War; I have noted this, although I do not&mdash;at present&mdash;anticipate
that any appeal with this object will be made.</p>

<p>“We arrived back from the operations which resulted in the
capture of Tekrit yesterday, and I was on the point of writing you
an account of our share in them and of the charge in which your
son Travers was wounded. The Army Commander has interested
himself personally in the case of your son, and will, I have no doubt,
have cabled you fully and given you the reasons why we think we
are justified in thinking his fate to be no worse than that of a
prisoner of war.</p>

<p>“Well, about 4.45 <small>P.M.</small> on the 5th November, the Regiment was
being held in reserve, so that should an opportunity arise to assist
the Infantry who had been assaulting the Turkish trenches all day,
we might be put in without delay, and our Brigadier evidently
thought the moment had arrived, so he ordered me to send out a
squadron to find the first line of trenches and to sweep up it
towards the Imam, which was the most conspicuous mark; ‘B’
Squadron was the first for duty, so I gave Captain Robinson his
orders, and the squadron went out. No sooner were they started
than I received orders to send a second squadron, and ‘C’
Squadron, under Lieutenant Norton, was sent out. I at once
received orders to take out the remaining two squadrons in
support; this I did, but the first two squadrons had got such a
good start of me that what followed I had to learn from the
survivors of the charge. It seems that on approaching that point
of the first-line trench which had been given him as an objective,
Robinson realised that it had been evacuated by the enemy, who
had retired in a N.W. direction, and that the left flank of our
Infantry were also approaching that point; he therefore halted his
squadron, and when ‘C’ Squadron had overtaken him, he explained
to Norton the situation, and his decision&mdash;which incidentally was
the true soldier’s instinct, and from a military point of view quite
correct&mdash;to attack the mass of the enemy, a few hundred in number,
who could be seen retiring in the open about 1200 yards to his left
flank. Accordingly the two squadrons wheeled to the left, and
almost in line, galloped along, one on either side of a long trench,
which had several strong points, at one of which Robinson was
killed, shot through the back of the head; and your son was last
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
seen pinned to the ground by his horse, which had been shot, and
trying to load his automatic pistol, and surrounded by a number of
Turks. The man who saw this said he also thought that Travers
was wounded, but there is only his evidence on this point. When
the squadrons had got back to the neighbourhood of our Infantry
line they were dismounted and advanced about 200 yards, with a
view to covering the escape of any of our men who had been
unhorsed or slightly wounded; but it was now almost quite dark,
and after allowing a reasonable time for any stragglers to rejoin, I
ordered a retirement on the Brigade.</p>

<p>“The Turks retired during the night, and our Infantry next morning
went over the ground, and buried six bodies, including Robinson’s;
they were unable to identify these as the Turks had stripped them
of everything, including identity discs; I however sent a party that
day, Tuesday, to ascertain what was possible about our missing,
and they identified the bodies of Captain Robinson, Sergts.
Newman and Gray, and Pte. Francomb. Two bodies, buried by
our Infantry, they were unable to find, and so remained unidentified;
but I think we are more than justified in presuming, under
the circumstances, that Travers was made prisoner of war by the
Turks, wounded perhaps but not necessarily so, and personally I
have every hope of hearing in course of time through our Red Cross
and the Red Crescent Associations that he is safe and well in the
hands of the Turks.</p>

<p>“I will say no more at present beyond expressing our universal
regret at losing so popular and so capable an officer, and our great
sympathy with you in the painful suspense which the uncertainty of
Travers’ fate must impose upon you.&mdash;Believe me, yours sincerely,</p>

15th November 1917.</i></p>

<p>“At last we are back at rest, so I will try and give you a sort of
account of our doings of late. We have been on the go now for
just on 8 weeks, so you can imagine how topping it is to get
back into a decent camp with a tent to yourself, &amp;c. This
morning I had a cup of tea and a biscuit when I was called,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
followed by a boiling-hot bath and a change of clothes&mdash;what
luxury!... The mail goes out to-night....</p>

<p>“Our Brigade left Childari about Sept. 25th, a week after the
other Brigade had gone out on the Ramadie stunt, which was a
great success, the Fourteenth doing very well, but losing their
C.O., and Medd Bridges is now commanding them.</p>

<p>“After four long marches during very hot weather (Robinson
went down with heat-stroke, but rejoined a fortnight later), we
took Mandali, some 100 miles N.E. of Childari up on the Persian
boundary, after very little opposition and no casualties.</p>

<p>“We stayed there almost three weeks, during which time we had
a certain amount of patrol-work, &amp;c., to do. Then, after two long
marches N.W., we took part in an affair in the right flank to kick
the Turks out of a pass over the Jubal Hamrin&mdash;it was quite a
relief to get among some hills, and away from miles and miles of
flat desert. We had very few casualties, and kicked the Turks out
more by surprise and rapidity of movement than by fighting. The
last morning the Brigade covered 15 miles in 1&frac14; hours!!&mdash;a pretty
hot and uncomfortable pace in full marching order over rough
ground. We then denied Qusil Robart to the Turks for three days,
and got shelled a bit; however, it was all very chusie until we were
suddenly hustled back to the Tigris, <i>vi&acirc;</i> Bacuba, to a more central
camp, so we don’t know what happened on the right flank since
we left.</p>

<p>“We took about five days to get here, and were then told that
we should be here for 21 days, the Brigade having covered some
400 miles in under five weeks. Our three weeks’ rest developed
into two days, when the Division which had reassembled were
hustled up N. on the right bank; we reached Samara after three
very cold and unpleasant night marches, and were very weary, so
we lay hidden in a nullah all the fourth day without any shade.
We moved again at 7 <small>P.M.</small> for our fourth night march, and after
covering some 27 miles found ourselves right out on the left flank
[of the Infantry], who captured Daur that day, whilst we
demonstrated only on the flank and got a bit shelled; however,
we underwent a new experience to us, but a very old one to
Londoners, as Fritz came over and dropped some bombs&mdash;very
unpleasant being bombed by an aeroplane; you feel so helpless
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
standing in an open desert holding your horse’s head. We camped
just S. of Daur, and next day had to go right out on the Infantry’s
left flank whilst they captured Aujah, and there we had to
reconnoitre the enemy’s position at Tekrit&mdash;a long march there
and back; we were shot at a good deal, but were very lucky,
and had under a dozen casualties in the Rgt., and only one man
actually killed. We got back late that night, and were woken up
at 7 <small>A.M.</small> next morning by Fritz dropping bombs on our Div.
camp, which he repeated again that evening, when luckily nearly
all the horses were down at the river watering. The Rgt. had
only three or four casualties from these bombs, but it was a horrid
sensation hearing the bomb come tearing through the air, and not
knowing where to expect the crash. That night we moved at
10 <small>P.M.</small> (another night march) for the battle of Tekrit.</p>

<p>“We were sent well out on the left flank, where we stayed all
the morning, and from where we saw our Infantry take two lines
of trenches under cover of a heavy artillery barrage, and also
where we were bombed again twice. This time I actually could
see the bombs leave the aeroplane, and watch them drop right up
to the moment of exploding on striking the ground. About 3 <small>P.M.</small>
we were moved right up on the Infantry’s flank, and stayed in
some hidden ground. At 4.39 the Infantry attacked, and a &frac14; hour
later we were galloping through our Infantry, who cheered us
like mad, towards the Turks. Robinson’s squadron led, followed
by ‘C’; then about 1000 yards behind ‘C’ the Colonel took us&mdash;‘D’
followed by ‘A.’ ‘B’ and ‘C’ got right into the Turks
and beyond, or as much into them as you can expect, considering
the place was full of deep trenches (we who were some way behind
‘B’ and ‘C’ crossed four lines of trenches), and Bob was killed
at the farthermost point reached by the charge&mdash;instantaneously&mdash;shot
through the head. We got his body and buried it the next
day after the Turks had cleared off. Williams-Taylor, also in
‘B,’ was last seen lying wounded under his dead horse. However,
as his body was nowhere to be found next day, we hope, and have
reason to, that he is alive and a prisoner. ‘D’ was the third
squadron in the charge, and though we crossed four trenches we
never actually reached the Turks, whom we saw just in front;
and when the Colonel, who was leading us, saw ‘B’ and ‘C’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
galloping back, he gave the order to retire and took us some way
back where we got into dismounted action. My horse (not
Matches, whom I was resting) was badly cut through the stifle,
just as we got the order to retire&mdash;however, he just managed to
get me back and out of it, altho’ he had to jump four trenches;
he was a very good young horse, and I was sorry to lose him. The
Rgt. was again very fortunate, as the rifle-fire, altho’ of course
(why, I don’t know) not at all on the same scale as at Lajj, was
quite unpleasant enough. We only had some 28 casualties and 60
horses. Personally, I don’t think the game was worth the candle,
especially when you think of Bob, the best fellow in the Rgt.;
but other people don’t all seem to agree with me, and the Corps
Commander gave the Division great praise for our assistance all
that night, and the Rgt. got it doubly from the Brigade Division.
The most pleasant part was to hear our Infantry cheering us as
we cleared the trenches, and galloped between them and the Turk.</p>

<p>“We charged at 4.45 <small>P.M.</small> on 5th Nov., exactly three years since
I left for the 11th, and didn’t get back into a camp, having
collected wounded, &amp;c., until 2 in the morning. We took six days

<p>“I must just write you a short line to let you know how your
brother, Captain S. O. Robinson, or Bob as we all loved to call
him, died. I shall hope later on to send you a more detailed
account of the action, but in the meantime an abbreviated account
must suffice.</p>

<p>“On November 5th the Cavalry Division was co-operating with
the Infantry in the attack on Tekrit, and at 4.45 or thereabouts
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
in the afternoon, I received orders to send a squadron to charge
the Turkish trenches on the left of our Infantry. Bob’s squadron,
‘B,’ was the first for duty, and I sent it, and soon afterwards sent
‘C’ Squadron in support; these two squadrons rode up to the
Turkish front-line trench, found it evacuated, found the left flank
of our Infantry, with a mass of Turks estimated at 3 or 4
hundred retiring in the open to the N.W. or left front. Bob at
once, with the instinct of a true soldier, decided to charge these
Turks, and proceeded to do so with the two squadrons.</p>

<p>“When they reached the big mass of Turks, a m&ecirc;l&eacute;e naturally
occurred. Bob was seen taking on four Turks with his sword, and
was shot through the head by one of them; he was killed instantaneously
(incidentally his trumpeter, Maguire, from whom we gather
this description, claims to have shot this particular Turk with his
revolver). The squadron went on a couple of hundred yards or so,
then turned, and came through the Turks again, and eventually
reached our lines in safety. By this time it was dusk, and after
dark the Turks retired; next day our Infantry came up, and found
several bodies stripped, even of their identity discs, and buried them
lightly in the trenches. We had gone back that night to bivouac
some miles, but on Tuesday (6th) I sent a small party to go over
the ground to ascertain what they could; this party found and
identified Bob’s body and that of three others of our men, and
next day, the 7th, I went myself with the C. of E. Padre, Lt.
Stirling, and 5 men, collected all the bodies, buried them deep, and
the Padre read the burial service over them. We could not mark
the spot, but we took records of the exact position where they were
buried.</p>

<p>“Major Twist is writing, and will see to his effects in the
Regiment.</p>

<p>“In offering you all my deepest sympathy in your loss, I should
like to add that his loss will be most keenly felt in the Regiment,
and by many outside of it. If his brother officers loved him for his
kindness and simplicity of character, his men adored him for the
same qualities and for his justness, and I personally mourn the loss
of a true friend; but he died the death of a gallant soldier fighting
sword in hand against superior odds, a death that few Cavalry
officers can ever hope to meet&mdash;to so few is it given,&mdash;an end that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
will live long in the history of the Regiment, if not in the history

of Tekrit, Nov. 5th, 1917, which deals with the Cavalry, and
showing how co-operation with the Infantry can be carried out

    <td>The usual artillery and heavy guns, and 5.9’s and heavy howitzers.</td>
  </tr></table>

<p>“The Cav. Div. had the task of protecting the W. flank, and
early in the morning of the 5th had gained touch with the whole
of the enemy’s entrenched flank, a distance of some 6 miles. The
Infantry, meanwhile, were marching into position for an assault on
the line Z-X. Owing to the heat, and telephone wires being continually
cut, this attack had not reached farther than the first
line of trenches.</p>

<p>“However, at 4.30 <small>P.M.</small>, Nth Div., Nth Bde. leading, attacked,
under a heavy barrage by our guns, the trenches Z-X, 2nd and 3rd
lines. Immediately, on Infantry’s left, was the Cav. Div.&mdash;2 Regiments
of Nth Bde. at point B in position of readiness (Point B
was a deep water-course, with a bluff on the N. side), and 1 Regt.
slightly N.W. on the left, with the Nth Bde. to the N.</p>

<p>“On the right of these two Regiments was a subsection of M.G.’s,
‘R,’ and on the left one section ‘L.’ These M.G.’s were, until
the Infantry attack came off, firing on enemy’s trench-line X-Y,
and covering the advance of dismounted Cavalry patrols, enabling
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
the latter to approach to within 800 yds.&mdash;1000 yds. of enemy’s trench.
During the whole day the Turkish gunners were busy ranging on
the Cavalry with heavy field-guns, and a number of casualties
resulted both in men and horses.</p>

<p>“As the Infantry attacked the ‘R’ section, (sub) ‘R,’ was able
to bring heavy fire in enfilade on trench at point Z, and this had
the effect of completely protecting the flank of our attacking
Infantry, and it was significant that during the whole advance to
X-Z, no enemy fire was opened from Z flank. The Infantry remarked
that this co-operation undoubtedly saved many casualties.
A few moments later the Infantry had carried the 2nd line of
trenches, the Hussars and a squadron of Lancers (Ind. Cav.) having
been collected at Point B, emerged from cover, and proceeded to
push in a mounted attack on the left of our Infantry against the
enemy, who appeared to be massing (behind the 3rd and 4th lines)
for a counter-attack.</p>

<p>“The right subsection, M.G.’s ‘R,’ was able to cover the advance
of the Cavalry, until it crossed the trench-line, and a little beyond
it. The two left subsections covered the left flank. Ranges from
1000 to 2000 yards.</p>

<p>“Another subsection, ‘T,’ followed the Hussars, mounted and
wheeling to the left, came into action under very hot fire about
1500 yards from enemy’s line, and pushed forward, its guns dismounted,
the horses being sent right back. This subsection was
able to bring covering fire to bear on the flanks of the advancing
Hussars.</p>

<p>“During the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e no fire action was feasible, owing to the large
amount of dust and general compression which was inevitable.</p>

<p>“The whole of this action was carried out on more or less open
ground, and under continuous gun and rifle fire from enemy’s rear
positions. The enemy machine-gun fire was fairly heavy, and
fired at extreme range, as the angle of descent testified, causing
casualties behind fairly good cover to our M.G. subsections.</p>

<p>“No. of rounds fired, 10,500.</p>

<p>“Men and horses were all day without water, and did not obtain
same until midnight, at which time the Infantry had taken over
from the Cavalry. Please find attached sketch of position.”

<p>“I must have the luck of the devil, as my horse got a flesh-wound&mdash;bullet&mdash;in
the leg, but is practically all right again now.</p>

<p>“We’ve got six honours in the Regt., my squadron leader and a

sqdns., and&mdash;hold your breath&mdash;they’ve given me one&mdash;Military
Medal. So I suppose you’ll have to put that in ‘The Times’ now&mdash;eh!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
what! It seemed to be nothing to me when I was in it. We
charged about 300 Infantry on the road and in the trenches,
with machine-guns and artillery behind ’em. We caught ’em
weak&mdash;just about 100 of us&mdash;2 weak sqdns.&mdash;in the mist of
dusk&mdash;and, my God! it seemed as if we were riding into Hades.
Funny thing tho’, I didn’t have wind up then, was feeling rather
elated cos we’d waited, and moved about, practically all day, for a
real rut at them, and been bombed from aeroplanes, shelled and
sniped, till we were just itching to get at ’em. Well, they got
pukka wind up when we got in amongst ’em, and started firing
wildly, some trying to use bayonets, others holding up their mitts
and shouting ‘Kamerad.’ Then we got order to rally as we
weren’t strong enough for pursuit. Starting to come back, I
spotted a youngster badly wounded in the foot and horse shot, so
I dismounted and put him up on my steed, which was too bobbery
to carry the two of us. He got back O.K. Then my fun started.
I had my revolver and about 14 rounds and began to think about
getting back somehow myself, when I spotted a chum of mine
lying about 60 yards from the trenches. Well, two of us tried to
get him out of it, but he would not have it&mdash;thigh shattered, blood
in spurts, mad with pain. J. Turk, seeing us retiring, heartened up
again and potted at us like blazes, shrapnel, machine-guns, and
every bally thing. At the finish I had to leave him, to my sorrow,
altho’ we got him away afterwards. Still he suffered a hell of a lot
from exposure, as the devils came out and stripped him&mdash;he’d be
unconscious by then&mdash;in the dark. I hear that he’s very bad in
hospital, but likely to recover.</p>

<p>“I haven’t got the gong yet, owing, I suppose, to Gen.
Maude’s death, but they’ve made as much fuss over it as if
we were&mdash;millions of V.C.’s. I’ve shaken hands with two
Generals, and been in about half a dozen parades till I’m fairly
fed up, and nearly said, ‘Keep the old gong and let’s have a bit
of peace.’</p>

quite fit; hope you are all the same, and that you, dear mother,

<p>After the lamented death of General Maude the command of the
British army in Mesopotamia devolved upon Lieut.-General Sir
W. R. Marshall, K.C.B., K.C.S.I., who had been one of the two
corps commanders during the advance on Baghdad.</p>

<p>In a despatch giving an account of the operations of the force
during the winter which followed General Maude’s death, General
Marshall explains in a few words the situation with which he had
to deal when he took over charge. After paying a warm tribute to
the work and character of his dead Chief, he writes: “When, therefore,
I had the honour of being appointed as his successor, the <i>moral</i>
of the army was magnificent, while organisation and training had
reached a high level of efficiency. The Turkish army, on the contrary,
was low in <i>moral</i>, and desertions from it were numerous and
frequent; on the Tigris and Euphrates they had retreated out of
rapid striking distance, and only on our right flank was there a good
opportunity of hitting them.”</p>

<p>General Marshall does not take up at this point the consideration
of any general questions outside the immediate purview of the Mesopotamian
force, but it may be observed here that the state of affairs
in the various theatres of war had of late greatly altered. The
collapse of Russia had made an immense difference in Europe, and
also in Asia, where Great Britain was now left practically alone in
face of the Turkish military power; and on the left of the great
Turkish battle-line the enemy had made a notable advance, threatening
the Caucasus and Northern Persia. On the other hand, it had
now become fairly clear that the long strain of the war was telling
on the Turks, who, it must be remembered, had entered into it when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
still shaken by their recent defeat at the hands of Bulgaria. The
defence of the Dardanelles, too, though successful, had tried them
more than the world suspected, and they had not shown themselves
capable of throwing forward from their base in Asia Minor, either
against General Allenby in Palestine on their right, or against
General Maude on their centre, such masses of troops as some had
expected. Indeed, on both these fronts, the British now seemed to
be numerically superior. But to revert to the operations on the
latter front.</p>

<p>In the circumstances presented to General Marshall he decided
to attack at once, while the weather was favourable, the Turkish
13th Corps, in the country north-east of Baghdad, which had been
so roughly handled earlier in the year. The attack was successful;
the Turks in this part of the country were driven northwards with
loss through Kara Tepe and Kifri, and the British hold on the great
main road into Persia was securely established, whilst further progress
was made in the Jebel Hamrin range. The Turks gave considerable
trouble by flooding some tracts of land, and they, of course,
resisted the British columns; but the fighting was not very severe,
and it was soon over. On the 8th of December the bulk of the
troops on this side were withdrawn into winter camps. It will be
understood that they had now reached high rough country, where
winter campaigning was not easy, and the enemy in this quarter also
had got out of reach.</p>

<p>The winter months were spent by General Marshall in developing
supply districts, in thoroughly opening up and establishing military
control over the Lower Euphrates, from the neighbourhood of Baghdad
to the sea, in relieving the state of famine to which the Turks had
reduced some of the western provinces of Persia, and in numerous
minor operations at various points of his widely extended charge.
These, he writes, consisted generally of reconnaissances by Cavalry
and light-armoured motor-cars, and of bombing raids by the Flying
Corps. It was a winter of consistent rain in the lowlands, with snow
on the higher ground, which made military movements difficult and
threw a heavy strain on the lines of communication.</p>

<p>On the other hand, as General Marshall reports, “by the middle
of December 1917 ... the military position had completely changed
owing to the magnificent successes gained by General Allenby in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
Palestine,” and this greatly strengthened his hands. Much, therefore,
was accomplished.</p>

<p>Finally, when the weather began to improve with the early
spring, it was decided that another blow must be struck at the Turks
on the left&mdash;that is, on the Upper Euphrates. In this quarter they
had been reinforced, and during the months of December and
January they began pushing their patrols down stream from Hit,
where the bulk of their troops were concentrated. General Marshall
gave orders that a column should march on Hit and drive away
the Turks, and that it should be aided in doing so by a Brigade of
Cavalry. Hit was occupied on the 9th of March, and the Turks fell
back to a stronger position some miles up the river. Here again
they were attacked, and this time with great effect. As at Ramadie,
in September, the Cavalry succeeded in getting right round into
the Turkish rear and cutting off their retreat. By the 30th of
March the Turkish force had been completely beaten, and the remains
of it had fled to a great distance, leaving over five thousand
prisoners in British hands.</p>

<p>The Thirteenth Hussars had no share in what General Marshall
calls “the magnificent work done by the Cavalry Brigade” on this
occasion. After their exertions in the autumn and early winter they
were given a rest, and remained from the middle of December 1917
until April of the following year at a winter camp on the Tigris
forty miles above Baghdad. There they found plenty to do in
training drafts and remounts and other work of the kind, for the
Regiment had suffered considerable loss in men and horses and
equipment; but for about four months they saw no more fighting or
marching, and were able to enjoy a comparatively quiet time with
some sport and amusement.</p>

<p>“We have been out on operations nearly a week, after a few
days’ rest in camp. As I write this we are on outpost against the
Turks in the hills, and our R.H.A. is shelling their positions, and
we are getting a few in R.S.V.P.! I am feeling very fit now in
spite of the cold, which has been very severe the last two or three
nights. We are being relieved some time this afternoon by another
Brigade, and shall be back into camp and have a little more comfort.
Whilst out here, miles away from Baghdad, a wireless message
came for me, making an appointment at the dentist!&mdash;in Baghdad
to-day, a thing I had asked for about a week ago. A great thing
war is now; fancy receiving this about 120 miles out in the blue

<p>“I spent a very happy Xmas, and was able to arrange quite a decent
dinner for the men. We are now in winter quarters, refitting and
training again: it is so nice to have a comfortable tent to sleep in
and on a bed. The weather has been very cold, 12 degrees of
frost on 2 days last week, and snow down to the bottom of the
foot-hills. The army is very well done out here now. We had
frozen beef and plum-pudding and even potatoes in rations for
Xmas day. We ourselves managed to secure a real live turkey
from a neighbouring village. All you people at home must be far
worse off for food than we are, and your experiences of air-raids
cannot be any too pleasant.</p>

it is frightfully cold at night now, much colder than this time last

<p class="caption"><i>Extract from Lance-Corporal Bowie’s Diary.</i></p>

<p>“Some 12 days later, on the 30th instant, we received sudden
orders to intercept a force of the enemy who were advancing through
the Sakaltutan Pass. After having covered some 60 miles in that
direction we came into contact with the 13th Turkish Army Corps
again at about 6 <small>P.M.</small> on the evening of the 2nd December. We
immediately deployed and attacked them, and, after having driven
in their outposts, we succeeded in advancing close up to the mouth
of the Pass, where the Brigade held them until about 12 noon the
following day, when we were relieved by the 6th Cavalry Brigade
who had been resting in bivouac some 10 miles back. Simultaneously
with this action our Infantry, under Lieut.-General Egerton,
had advanced up the right bank of the Diala river and had cleared
the whole area south of Qarah Tappah, and were advancing to attack
the Turks at the other end of the Pass. The following morning we
crossed the Shatt-el-Adhaim river and advanced up the right bank
as far as Abu-Ghuraib, where we threatened the Turkish right flank,
after which we returned in the afternoon and relieved the 6th Cavalry
Brigade, who were still holding the Pass. This Brigade were bombed
in their bivouac early the next morning by two enemy airmen; this
prevented them from relieving us for some hours. Meanwhile,
General Egerton’s force, co-operating with us, had attacked the
enemy in the rear, inflicting heavy casualties among them. The
enemy thus being attacked at both ends, he succeeded in escaping
over the hills (no small feat in itself), under cover of the night.
The Russian force of Cossacks under Lieut.-Colonel Bicharakoff
co-operated with us on the right flank throughout these operations.
The total British captures were 6 Turkish officers, including a
Brigadier Commander, 121 other ranks, and 2 guns.</p>

<p>“On the morning of the 6th we commenced our march back to
Sadiyah, going into bivouac for the night after doing some 12
miles. The following morning we sent out patrols to attack and
disperse some small enemy detachments who were reported to be
in the vicinity by our airmen. An exceptionally bad sand-storm
raged the whole of this day, during which we remained in bivouac.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
On our patrols returning and reporting all clear, we continued our
march for some 25 miles, bivouacking for the night at Sinajah.
Crossing the Tigris early the following morning, we arrived at our
former camp at about 2 <small>P.M.</small> on the 9th instant.</p>

<p>“A few days later we were issued with our winter clothing, and
about this time, too, the enemy airmen became very active, and
bombed in turn Sammara, Akab, Baghdad, and many of our camps
in between these places. They inflicted so many casualties among
our troops that elaborate precautions were taken against surprise
attacks. A system of trenches was connected all round the Cavalry
horse lines, which enabled us in the event of attack to untie our
horses from the lines, turn them about, and take cover ourselves
in the trenches whilst holding them. These precautions undoubtedly
saved us from a stampede when the enemy airmen paid us New
Year Day’s visit and bombed us incessantly until their supplies became
exhausted. They then flew merrily away in spite of all our batteries’
efforts and the 2 Archies, which were dug in down by the river
bank to protect us from these raids.</p>

<p>“Just previous to this raid, towards the end of December, we
received the good news that our Infantry had occupied Khaniquin
without opposition on the 7th December, and also that our troops
in Palestine, under General Allenby, had captured Jerusalem on
the same date. Whilst on January 2nd we received word that our
troops had occupied Qasr-i-Shirin without opposition.</p>

<p>“On January 15th the Fourteenth Hussars left the 6th Cavalry
Brigade which was with us at the time, under the command of
General Dunsterville, to operate in the neighbourhood of Baku,
which is situated on the borders of the Black Sea.</p>

<p>“On the 19th instant the Regiment held some sports, which were
the commencement of a series of sports and games, organised to
help break the monotony of camp life in this country, which so
depresses one’s spirit, especially at this time of the year. On this
day some excellent sports were witnessed, everybody doing their
utmost to be left in for the finals, which were to be held on the
27th instant, whilst in the evening our Concert Party gave a show
which proved a great success. The following day our football team
played the team of the monitor <i>Mantis</i>, which was anchored close
to our camp at the time, the result of the match being 1 goal to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
<i>nil</i> in our favour. We invited the whole of the crew to dinner
at our camp in the evening, every one spending a jolly time in
consequence.</p>

<p>“The following day we were again visited by enemy airmen, but
our batteries and Hotchkiss guns opened such a rapid and effective
fire that after vainly trying to bomb us for some time they finally
flew off in disgust, amidst the frantic cheers of the boys who were
interested spectators.</p>

<p>“Soon after this we commenced our sports, in which every event
was most keenly contested, and at the conclusion of the two days
the results were as follows: Individual Tent-Pegging was won by
our R.S.M., Mr Seekins; Skill at Arms by S.Q.M.S. Higgs; the best
troop-horse was C98, ridden by Pte. Shaw; Officers Jumping went
to Mr Macdonald; the Section Tent-Pegging to ‘B’ Squadron.
In the dismounted events, the 100 yards was won by L.-Cpl. Carter
in very good time, while the 1&frac12; mile relay race was won rather easily
by the team of ‘C’ Squadron, which included Sgt. Burgess, Sgt.
Moss, L.-Cpl. Carter, L.-Cpl. Smithers, L.-Cpl. Bush, and Pte.
Bowie. The tug-of-war was won by the ‘D’ Squadron team after
an exceptionally fine pull, which concluded the programme. At
about 8 <small>P.M.</small> the same evening our party gave another concert, this
time to the whole Division, being assisted in their efforts by some of
the crew of the monitor. This show proved a great success, every
one thoroughly enjoying a good evening’s entertainment. On January
26th some Divisional races were held on a course we had made some
2 miles west of our camp, the ground here being splendidly suited
for our purpose, being as flat as a billiard-table for many miles.</p>

<p>“On January 27th General Dunsterville’s force left Baghdad,
the following officers and N.C.O.’s from our Regiment accompanying
the force: Captain Annett, Lt. Cochrane, Sgt. Vernon, Sgt.
Taylor, and Sgt. Saunders.</p>

<p>“Commencing on February 22nd, a 3-days’ race meeting was
held at Akab by the 17th Infantry Division. The Regiment entered
several horses, only one of which was successful&mdash;namely, Captain
Blythe’s Army Pattern; while our Concert Party gave a show there
on the nights of the 22nd and 23rd, which were greatly admired by
all who witnessed them, the G.O.C. of that Division sending a letter
of congratulation to our Colonel in having such a talented party.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
Shortly after this, on the 28th inst., the Cavalry Division held some
athletic sports, in which several of the events were open to all
comers. In this the Regiment secured several prizes&mdash;namely, 1st
in the 100 yards for officers, Mr Osmond; the team of ‘C’
Squadron, L.-Cpl. Carter, L.-Cpl. Bush, Pte. Jones, and Pte. Bowie
gaining 2nd prize in the Relay Race. L.-Cpl. Bush also 2nd in
the Obstacle Race, while another 2nd prize was won by Pte. Bowie
in the Open Mile, our tug-of-war team of ‘C’ Squadron being
knocked out in the semi-final after a very game struggle. On March
4th we turned out a Rugby 15 to play the Australian Wireless
Section’s 15, who had played so far an unbeaten record, and
after a most exciting game the match ending in a draw, neither side
being able to score.</p>

<p>“The following day being the anniversary of our charge at Lajj,
the Regiment held a singing competition in the evening. This
proved to be highly amusing, judging by the vociferous cheering
which greeted the competitors’ efforts, the first prize for sentimental
songs being won by Sgt. Burgess, and the first for comic by Pte.
Bowie. At the conclusion of this, our Colonel made a speech in
honour of our comrades who fell in the ‘Charge.’ On reading the
names out the Colonel was almost overcome with emotion, and it
was only with difficulty that he was able to complete.</p>

<p>“About this time we received the news that our forces operating
on the Euphrates river had captured Hit on the 7th inst., and on
the night of the 9th the enemy had evacuated Sahilijah, abandoning
2 mountain guns and much ammunition.</p>

<p>“On the 14th the 2nd Baghdad Race Meeting was held, also the
semi-finals and finals of football, hockey, polo, golf, and boxing
tournaments were contested during the week. Our football team
was knocked out in the third round by the 25th Machine-gun
Squadron, by one goal to <i>nil</i>, after a hard-fought game. The outstanding
feature of this tournament was the match between the
Worcesters and the Buffs, the first game they played being of 60
minutes’ duration; but as neither side was able to score extra time
was allowed, and they played on for three periods of 20 minutes
each, and again neither side was able to gain the advantage. The
match was then postponed until the following day. On the replay,
which lasted with extra time, some 2 hours and 40 minutes with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
still no score being registered, both teams withdrew from the
tournament. The Regiment ran several horses in the racing, Lt.
Ormrod’s ‘Venus’ again winning the Baghdad Cup. This time
she was ridden by Frank Wootten, the famous jockey, who happened
to be in Baghdad at the time.</p>

<p>“Some little time after this we received the news that our Column,
commanded by Major-General Brooking, operating on the Euphrates
river, had, on the 26th inst., attacked the 50th Turkish Division
at Khan Baghdadi. The Cavalry cutting off the enemy’s retreat
along the Aleppo Road, they surrendered with their Commander,
the total captures being 18 Germans, including 2 officers, 212 Turkish
officers, and 5236 Turkish other ranks, 12 guns, 57 machine-guns,
2 German wireless stations. During the six days’ fighting they
pursued the fugitives of this force to a point some 73 miles
north of Awah, destroying in this village some 300,000 rounds
of gun ammunition and some 3&frac14; million rounds of rifle ammunition.</p>

<p>“On April 9th some Divisional Races were held on the racecourse
near our camp, and in these several of our horses proved
successful, Lt. Ormrod’s ‘Venus’ winning the &frac12;-mile steeple-chase,
and ‘Whiskers’ by the same owner was first past the post
in the 6 furlongs, but on an objection being raised was disqualified
later. Mr Welstead’s ‘Nightshade’ with its owner up won the
sixth race, while Mr Jones’ ‘B3,’ ridden by Sgt. Holloway, won
the Novices’ Flat Race.</p>

<p>“On the following day we received the welcome news that leave
to India was granted, and a party consisting of 2 officers and 12 men
left the same day <i>en route</i> for India to enjoy a well-earned 28 days’
furlough.</p>

<p>“A few days later, on April 14th, we commenced an Inter-Football
Tournament. The first game was between ‘B’ and ‘D’ Squadrons;
this resulted in a win for ‘B’ by 2 goals to <i>nil</i>. The next match
was between ‘A’ and ‘C’ Squadrons, and this was a win for ‘A’
by 2 goals to 1, while the following day ‘B’ played ‘A.’ This
match was very keenly contested and aroused great excitement,
the result, after extra time had been allowed, being a draw of 1
goal each. Replaying again the following day, the result this time
was a draw of 2 goals, and this also after extra time.”

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.<br />

<span class="large">THE SUMMER OF 1918&mdash;KULAWAND AND TUZ KERMATLI.</span></h2>

<p>The season of military operations in the country to the north-east
of Baghdad, where the British and Turks now faced each other,
may be said to begin with the month of April, and in that month
General Marshall’s troops were ready to move again.</p>

<p>Before any movements on a large scale began, however, General
Marshall had to deal with two troublesome complications, one on
his left and one on his right.</p>

<p>To the left, in the Mahomedan holy cities of Nejef and Kerbela,
beyond the Euphrates, the British invasion of Mesopotamia had
naturally caused some excitement, and this had been fostered by
German intrigues and gold. The holy cities do not belong to the
same branch of Islam as the Turks, being “Shia,” not “Sunni,”
or, as one might say, Protestant, not Catholic; and having been
very carefully treated by the British they had shown a friendly
spirit enough. Still they were Mahomedan, and contained some
fanatical elements. In the month of January British troops had
been attacked near Nejef, and a few weeks later the British
political officer was murdered. Some punishment had to be inflicted
for these offences, and though General Marshall would not attack
the sacred town, it was blockaded and called upon to deliver up
the murderers. Happily the well-behaved inhabitants, under the
guidance of their religious leaders, decided to accept the British
terms, and the whole affair was satisfactorily settled.</p>

<p>At the same time as this trouble arose to the westward, some
Persian tribes on the east began to respond to the incitement and
gold of German emissaries, and it was found necessary, as General
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
Marshall says, to “give them a lesson.” But this trouble also proved
to be short-lived. Friendly tribesmen took action against the
malcontents, and with the aid of a small British column completely
defeated them. They lost heavily, “and our aeroplanes turned their
defeat into a rout.”</p>

<p>In the meantime, while these complications were being put
straight, General Marshall had worked out his scheme of action
against the Turks, and had decided that they should again be
attacked to the north-east of Baghdad, so as to drive them farther
away and make the Persian line of communication more secure. His
intention was to expel them from the area about Kara Tepe, Kifri,
and Tuz Kermatli, which will be found marked on the sketch-map,
p. 201, and to occupy those points, thus turning and subjugating
the troublesome range of Jebel Hamrin.</p>

<p>It was a difficult operation if the Turks fought well, and General
Marshall’s scheme of action was carefully worked out. Several
columns were to move from different points, and it is not easy to
follow in detail the movements of each. It will suffice to say that
during the latter part of April and the earlier part of May 1918,
in spite of mountainous ground and torrents of rain, which caused
heavy floods in the rivers and washed away temporary bridges&mdash;in
spite too of some stubborn fighting on the part of the enemy&mdash;the
whole area was completely cleared and the country was occupied as
far north as Kirkuk, one hundred and thirty miles from the railhead
and considerably more than that distance from Baghdad. The
British losses were very small&mdash;only twenty-six killed and two
hundred and ten wounded&mdash;while the Turks lost heavily, over three
thousand in prisoners alone.</p>

<p>General Marshall had good reason to be satisfied with this result.
“Owing,” he says, “to the distance covered by these operations,
and to the bad weather which prevailed throughout, the work of the
troops was very arduous, and I have nothing but admiration for the
good work put in by all arms and the excellent co-operation which
was maintained between them.” This co-operation included much
continuous work done by the Cavalry, and on at least two occasions
they had the chance of attacking the enemy as Cavalry, mounted and
sword in hand.</p>

<p>On both these occasions the Thirteenth were well to the fore.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
They were no longer with their own Brigade, but had temporarily
taken the place of their old comrades of the Fourteenth Hussars
in the 6th Brigade, then commanded by Brigadier-General Holland
Pryor. General Marshall describes the first action in the following
words: “The 6th Cavalry Brigade ... after an arduous night march
overtook the Turks who had ... taken up a defensive position at
Kulawand.... Feigning a frontal attack, whilst gradually working
round the enemy’s right flank, our Cavalry cut the enemy’s lines
of retreat and then charged right through his Infantry, killing some
two hundred, including two battalion commanders, and capturing
565 prisoners, a mountain-gun, and considerable booty.” This was a
fine performance, and brought the Regiment much credit. It was
followed up by some skilful manœuvring which induced the Turks to
hold a position at Tuz Kermatli, where a day or two later there was
another considerable action. Here again the Cavalry did well, and
the Thirteenth got another chance. This time the actual charge was
a smaller affair, confined to a couple of troops under Lieutenant
Macdonald, but it was spirited and successful, the two troops galloping
a nest of machine-guns, and taking a considerable number of prisoners
with little loss to themselves.</p>

<p>On the 7th of May Kirkuk was taken, and the short campaign
came to an end. “Difficulties of supply,” says General Marshall,
“due to distance and state of ground, now made it imperative
to stop further pursuit,” and a few days later most of the
British troops were withdrawn to their summer camps. The Thirteenth
returned to their old camp at Chaldari, near Baghdad,
arriving on the 22nd of May, and there they remained throughout
the summer months.</p>

<p>It proved to be an important and anxious time for the Commander
of the Army, as a force under Major-General Dunsterville
was sent into Persia, and eventually crossed the Caspian to Baku,
where there was some severe fighting. There was much work to
be done also in Mesopotamia itself, and so far as the climate
permitted, military training went on steadily, a special feature
being the development of schools of instruction. But owing to
the extreme heat the summer was for the bulk of the troops a
period of inactivity, and it was found possible to send a large
number of officers and men on leave to India. They wanted all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
the rest they could get, for they still had some hard marching and
fighting before them, and the Thirteenth, in their pleasant camp
at Chaldari, thoroughly enjoyed the respite.</p>

<p>“<i>April 26-27, 1918.</i>&mdash;The column moved at midnight and marched
till 4.45 <small>A.M.</small>, arriving at Tel Sharif at that time. The road was
difficult to find in many places, and in the numerous nullahs which
were crossed the going was deep. When the position had been
fixed at dawn, the column moved forward for 2 miles, and then fed
at 6 a.m. After &frac12; an hour halt the Regiment with advance-guard of
C. and C. moved to M. 27 Central, and halted till 9 <small>A.M.</small> At that
time the Regiment was ordered to move on the Kulawund position,
and with L.A.M. cars and Lewis guns and Ford vans turn
it from the W. end by enfilade fire. Some difficulty was found
in locating the position, and it was not till 11.30 that it was
reached and found unoccupied. The L.A.M. cars and Fords had
been unable to get forward owing to water-logged country and
nullahs. A number of Turks with some tents were seen to
be in position on the Tuz-Kifri road, close to the hills, and their
numbers were estimated by an aeroplane at 250. By 12 noon
the G.O.C. Brigade had moved forward, and arrangements were
made for a simultaneous attack by the 3 Regiments. At about
12.20 a move forward was made, the Brigade advancing in line of
column of wings, in the order 22nd, 21st, 13th from the right. I
understand that both Indian Cavalry Regiments advanced in line
whilst we were in column of wings: I am not sure whether the
22nd had all four squadrons or only two. The Regiment had ‘C’
and ‘D’ Squadrons in front line under Captain Godfree, ‘B’
and half ‘A’ in the second, at about 200 yards’ distance, the remaining
troop of ‘A’ being left as guard to our left flank, dressing
station, &amp;c., and the H.G. guns being sent to the flanks. The
leading wing on nearing the road shouldered to the right and were
in a position to co-operate with the 21st Cav. when Captain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
Godfree received orders from the Brigade to take no further part
in the attack, but to join the Headquarters near Kulawund
village. While he did this the 2nd Wing, leaving a troop of ‘A’
as escort to the Regimental Aid Post, moved to the Kifri-Tuz
road and scattered along it to the left or Tuz direction, and succeeded
in collecting about 50 prisoners. Two or three machine-guns
were in action against us until we were within 300 yards of
the road, and were replied to by the H.G. troop of ‘D’ Squadron
from our left flank. A number of the enemy succeeded in getting
away into the ridge of hills E. of the road where Cavalry could
not pursue, and after despatching the prisoners to Brigade H.Q. the
wing rallied and moved to a mound at the edge of the Kulawund
position. From captured officers’ statements it was clear that this
Cavalry attack took the enemy entirely by surprise. The enemy
troops engaged consisted of the 5th Regiment, which had received
orders on the evening of the 26th to withdraw from Tuz. Expecting
only an Infantry attack, on the following morning they
evacuated their positions without undue haste, and after halting
several hours ... were on their way to Tuz on the 27th, when
they were overtaken.</p>

<p>“<i>April 29.</i>&mdash;We drew back and circled to the W. behind the
battery, and were ordered to get touch with the 21st and 22nd
Cav. and then attempt to get across the Tuz-Tan road to stop
the enemy’s retreat. Moving W., it was found that the 22nd and
21st were held up by a nest of M. guns on a small knoll. At the
time of our arrival these were not directed on us, and appeared to
have left their position. Two troops of ‘B’ were accordingly
pushed forward, and led off so as to leave this knoll on their right.
After a short distance they came under M.G. fire, and 2nd Lt.
MacDonald wheeled the two troops to the right, thus putting his
own troop in front and that of Sgt. Brencher in rear. He galloped
the hill and took it&mdash;the enemy, except two, escaping being sabred
by putting their hands up when the men were on them. This
action opened the way across the plain, and the three Regiments,
21st, 13th, 22nd from the right, moved across, meeting small
bodies of the enemy, and killing or taking them prisoners.”

“7<span class="smcap">th Cavalry Brigade, M.E.F.,<br />
In the Field</span>, <i>1st May 1918</i>.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear General</span>,&mdash;Your note with enclosures regarding Regimental
Monuments and Gravestones reached me only a few days
ago, when we were already on the trek of our present stunt....</p>

<p>“I am sorry to say I quite forget the contents of my letter to
Symons to which you refer, but I imagine it dealt with our part in
the battle of Tekrit; since that time we have been almost continuously
in one camp, on the Tigris, about 40 miles above
Baghdad, and although for more than four months we did not
have a shot fired in anger we were far from idle&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, when
the wet weather made it possible to be otherwise. Not only were
we able to put in a lot of much-needed&mdash;on account of the
numerous officers and other reinforcements during the past six
months&mdash;instruction in equitation and elementary and secondary
drill and training, but we were able to have games and sports&mdash;both
mounted and dismounted&mdash;for the men, and polo for the
officers; we also had the opportunity of getting fitter than at any
time since we have been in this country, and I doubt very much
whether men or horses have ever been fitter physically than when
we started out, ten days ago, for this stunt. Only one Brigade
of Cavalry is being utilised, and it is not the one to which we
properly belong, but we are taking the place of the 14th, who are
scattered about on an independent mission. Our march to the
rendezvous was not propitious, as we were dogged by heavy rain
and thunder, which made life on operation scale, without tents, a
delusion and a snare for four days, but we got through with only
one case of pneumonia. Once we got started on this stunt&mdash;the
object of which has been to clear the whole of our northeasterly
front of the enemy&mdash;we began to get into a country of
magnificent crops and glorious grazing, in which the horses have
been revelling, and growing visibly bigger. The operations themselves
have partaken more of the nature of South African drives,
and Johnny Turk was, I think, caught napping by the largeness of
the scale of the operations, and he has been so badly fed lately
that he could not travel sufficiently quickly to escape us; however,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
he put up, as he always does, a jolly good fight when cornered,
and as we were unable to close the fourth side to the square&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
on the north, where a steep ledge of rock, backed by hilly country,
discounted our mobility&mdash;a good few got away. However, we have
accounted for nearly 2000 prisoners, ten large and very many
machine guns, and our casualties have been less than 250 (in the
whole force), so I suppose we may reckon the operations as
having been fairly successful. Of course, from the nature of
things, the principal r&ocirc;le fell to the Cavalry, and even the Pan-Infantry
men were fain to admit that we have done it well. On
the first day we came into touch with the enemy&mdash;mostly troops
retiring from outside positions, from which they had been driven
by the Infantry; but, covered by the garrison and guns of the
aforesaid rocky ledge, the three Regiments of the Brigade galloped
in two lines of wings over about 1&frac12; miles of country towards the
ledge, and swung right-handed along the foot of it, the net result
being about 600 prisoners and several machine-guns. The next
day there was a pause, as the main position, which was pretty
well served by big guns, still remained, and we could not hope to
take it without the help of the Infantry; but next morning the
latter came through our outposts, and we concentrated on the
left flank and began the advance, which I may fairly claim
the Regiment initiated, which put the finishing touch to the
operations. A good few of the enemy no doubt escaped through
the hill country, and perhaps he got a gun or two away,
but certainly a thousand prisoners and ten guns fell into our
hands.</p>

<p>“When I claim that the Regiment initiated the final advance, I
must explain the situation in more detail: over night 2 squadrons
were on outpost duty on the left bank of the river, and two troops
of a third squadron were away with the first batch of 500
prisoners; the balance of the Regiment with which I was, was on
the right of the Cavalry Brigade, advancing up the right bank of
the river; we were held up at dusk by the enemy in an
entrenched position, and remained where we stood all night; soon
after daybreak the Infantry took over our line, and the Brigadier
sent me off to the left flank to try and get across the path of the
retiring enemy. I found that the two Regiments of Indian Cavalry
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
had been trying to advance with the same object for a couple of
hours, but were held up by small parties of enemy entrenched on
knolls and well supplied with machine-guns. I determined to
advance, and put one of my few remaining sabre troops into the
scouting line under MacDonald, a lad who only joined us 6 or 8
months ago. When we got about 800 yards from the nearest
knoll he met very heavy machine-gun fire, but as it was apparently
directed against his left flank, he at once gathered his troops to
the right, and following a circular path he galloped the hill, taking
the gunners in flank and reverse, and in less than five minutes had
the whole party of Turks killed or marching as prisoners to the
rear, and 4 machine-guns captured. He had only one man badly
wounded. It was, I think, without exception the quickest and
prettiest&mdash;not to say the most successful&mdash;small piece of work it
has been my fortune to witness. This little episode put great
heart into the Indians, and thereafter it was almost a race for the
foot-hills; all opposition went like a house of cards, and it was
only a question of mopping up. I, on behalf of the Regiment
and MacDonald, have received congratulations on all sides, and
the Brigade and Divisional Commanders have promised to
support my recommendation for immediate rewards, so I hope
MacDonald and his troop may get the honours they have earned
so well.</p>

<p>“With the exception of Twist and of my Adjutant Gowan, I
have no other officers with pre-war training and experience, but we
have been most exceptionally lucky in our temporary officers; for
this, I think, I have to thank Ronnie Brook chiefly, and he would,
I am sure, be interested to see the account of the operations,
should you have it copied.&mdash;With all good wishes, yours sincerely,</p>

<p>“<i>P.S.</i>&mdash;The following coincidence of special interest has come to
light. Among material captured by MacDonald on the knoll was
a signaller’s telescope, which he gave to his signaller, Sgt.
Burgess. The latter at once recognised it as the one he himself
lost at Lajj on March 5th last year, when his horse was shot and
he had to abandon his gun.”

charges, in the past week, and the outstanding feature of the
operations, which has been very successful, and of which I am
sending an account to B.P. [Sir Robert Baden-Powell], has been
a gallant and brilliant charge by a troop of the 13th under
MacDonald, a Scotch lad who joined us about 6 months ago.</p>

<p>“After writing to you on the third of this month we continued
our drive northwards for a matter of about 60 miles, the Turks
pursuing their usual tactics&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, holding us up at strong positions
with their big guns until dark enabled them to get away their valuable
papers and other important stuff. In this way we made them
evacuate the country as far north as Altum Kupri.</p>

<p>“I do not hesitate to give names now, as I see Reuter has published
the message from Candler, the correspondent, in almost the identical
words that I gave him&mdash;he was messing with us during that period&mdash;which
is within striking distance, not more than 70 miles, of Mosul,
the big Turkish base.</p>

<p>“Owing to the difficulties of transport we had been on half rations,
but we got most glorious grazing for the horses in most places, so
they did not suffer much until we struck the Jebel Hamrin with its
brackish water and no grazing. Right up there the climate was
really good, and we could work all day, though, of course, it was
hottish, and on one or two nights we got wet through, for, of course,
we had no tents. But in this case also, as soon as we struck the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
Jebel Hamrin on our return, the sun became very powerful and the
sand-flies very bad.</p>

<p>“However, the operations were very interesting, although the
Regiment had no opportunity of doing more than ordinary work,
because Johnny Turk declined to come to grips; but as the Brigade
put it: ‘You did just what I wanted you to, I could not ask you to
do more,’ I don’t think we had any cause to grumble....</p>

<p>“When I wrote you from Mendali, in October, that we were short
of food, I referred only to mess stores and extras; rations have
always been good, especially when we were within measurable
distance of the railway, when we got most excellent frozen beef.
Indeed, I expect we are being much better fed than you poor people.”</p>

<p>“Fate decreed that we were not to finish this tournament, as on
the following morning we were ordered out to take part in operations
again. This was the 18th of April, and we had to leave camp some
few hours later than ordered; owing to the extremely bad weather
and the high floods having broken the pontoon bridge over the
river, it was impossible to cross the Tigris till midday. Heavy rain
continued to fall throughout the day, which made the going very
difficult, and we finally arrived at Baqubah at about 8 <small>P.M.</small>, where we
picketed down for the night. Our transport arrived in at 9.15 <small>P.M.</small>
Every one being so thoroughly wet through, and the weather being
so bitterly cold, a rum issue was ordered, after which we were
fortunately able to obtain shelter for the night in a rest-camp near
by. Owing to the heavy rains which had fallen the column did
not march for Abu-Jisrah until 10.30 <small>A.M.</small> the following morning, and
after some very heavy going we made that place at about 3.30
<small>P.M.</small> Our transport experienced great difficulty in getting along, and
did not arrive until some two hours later. The heavy rains continued
throughout the night. The following morning, April 20th, it was
found impossible to move in consequence of the exceedingly heavy
rains, which continued till 2 <small>P.M.</small>, and made the ground a perfect
quagmire, and absolutely impossible for wheels, the men during
these two days having a most uncomfortable time owing to the
impossibility of erecting any sort of shelter. An incident worthy of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
note here was an impromptu football match, played amid a perfect
sea of mud, in which the ball not infrequently became imbedded,
whilst the rain poured down in torrents. All this, however, did not
deter the players, who, after a most strenuous game, did obtain
some little warmth from this exercise. At 11.30 <small>A.M.</small> on the morning
of the 21st instant we continued our march to Sharaban, where we
arrived about 4 <small>P.M.</small> Here we joined up with the 6th Cavalry
Brigade, who were in bivouac there. During the next two days we
remained in bivouac, whilst we endeavoured to free ourselves of some
of the mud with which every one was plastered, grazing our horses
meanwhile. Here also our squadrons were arranged to conform
with the formation of the 6th Brigade; each squadron was to
consist of three sabre troops and one Hotchkiss-gun troop. On
the morning of April 24th the Regiment paraded at 9.30 <small>A.M.</small>, but
owing to heavy rain falling again we did not move off until 11 <small>A.M.</small>,
when we marched at the head of the Brigade crossing the Cutthroat
and Auction Bridges; we halted at Ruz for a short time, and marching
on again we crossed the Table Mountain Bridge over the Diala
river at 1.30 <small>P.M.</small> Here we watered and fed our horses, afterwards
moving off again with the 22nd Native Cavalry, commanded by
Lieut.-Colonel Young. We marched on to Abu-Haiar, arriving there
about 5.30 <small>P.M.</small>, and bivouacking for the night. The following
morning at 11 <small>A.M.</small> we marched to Ain-Lailah, which we reached at
3.30 <small>P.M.</small> We bivouacked that night about 1&frac12; miles south of
the Pass. The Column commenced marching through the Pass
at 3 <small>A.M.</small> the following morning, but the Regiment being Rear
Guard did not march through till 7.30 <small>A.M.</small>, and then proceeding on
to the Nahrin river, where we watered and fed our horses. Resuming
our march till 11 <small>A.M.</small>, we joined the remainder of the Column,
who were in bivouac at 12.15 <small>P.M.</small> Here one troop proceeded to
reconnoitre the road over which we were to make a night march
the same night, after which they returned to bivouac at dusk.
Marching again at midnight, the Column proceeded to Tel-Sharia,
arriving at about 4.45 <small>A.M.</small> The road was very difficult to find in
many places, and the nullahs which we had to cross were very deep,
many being almost full of water, owing to the recent heavy rains.
After our patrols had located the enemy at dawn the Column moved
forward some 2 miles and halted till 6.30 <small>A.M.</small>, when the Regiment
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
was ordered to advance another mile and halt. At 9 <small>A.M.</small> we received
the order to advance on to the Kulawand position: accompanied by
our armoured cars and some Lewis guns mounted on Ford cars, we
proceeded to attack it at the west end. We experienced great
difficulty in gaining the position, not through an enemy resistance,
which strangely enough was not offered, but through the water-logged
condition of the country and the very deep nullahs, and owing to
this our armoured cars and Ford cars were unable to continue the
advance. On us eventually gaining the position we found it to be
unoccupied. The enemy, having retired during the night, were
located by our airmen a little later, who reported them to be holding
a position on the Tuz-Kifri road, close up to the foot of the hills.
Although we had no support within 20 miles of us, it was decided
to attack them at once. Having worked our way up to some large
Moards [? mounds] some 1&frac34; miles from their main position, we took
cover here to give [? save] our horses. Some few minutes later we drew
our swords and trotted into the plain where the 10 squadrons were
formed into an extended line in the formation of a scythe. As we
rode on at this pace parties of the Turks started running down the
road, while other groups took up positions in the rough ground and
water-cuts, or kneeling in the high corn opened fire on us. Here
the Turks showed some of their old spirit in the stand they made,
but the sudden flash of our swords in the sun which made a wide
arc of light seemed to take the heart out of them, and their fire was
wild and high, and our casualties few. Our artillery kept up a
creeping barrage on the village as we attacked, and our line maintaining
this pace until within some 500 yards of the enemy, when we
lowered our swords and charged into them. Our aeroplanes which
took part in the action flew very low and increased the enemy’s
confusion with bombs and machine-gun fire. Over 150 Turks were
killed and 538 prisoners were taken, also 2 mountain-guns, very
few of them escaping in the hills. Meanwhile Kifri-ain-Faris and
Chanan-Keurri had been occupied by our other columns without
opposition, and our movements were so rapid that 2 battalions of
the enemy had to take to the hills in order to escape the net we were
spreading for them. We afterwards heard that this force had been
robbed and disarmed by the Kurds, who never lose an opportunity of
revenging themselves on the Turk, and even those who escaped us in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
the Kulawand charge returned and surrendered to us rather than face
these tribesmen. After sending back our prisoners we moved forward
to reconnoitre Tuz, and we soon came under some very heavy accurate
gun-fire until about 4 <small>P.M.</small>, when orders were received to withdraw.
We then moved back some ten miles and bivouacked behind our line
of outposts for the night. At 6 <small>A.M.</small> the following morning ‘A’ and
‘D’ Squadrons were sent to reconnoitre Tuz, the Brigade following
some half an hour later, while the 21st Cavalry were despatched to
find a ford over the river Aqsu at Khasradalah. ‘A’ and ‘D’
Squadrons soon came under fire from Tuz and suffered some
casualties. Meanwhile the remainder moved on to Khasradalah in
an endeavour to surround Tuz, but were held up by enemy machine-guns
in position on the banks of the Aqsu river; and the armoured
cars being unable to advance along the Kifri-Tuz road, no farther
advance was possible. We halted here for the night after having
crossed the river, while ‘C’ Squadron and a section of the Machine-Gun
Squadron were thrown forward on each side of the track; ‘B’
Squadron, having all the horses, were some 1500 yards in rear down
by the river. Intermittent firing was carried on throughout the night.
At 4.30 <small>A.M.</small> we stood to arms and saddled up, receiving word that
our 2 Infantry columns would advance at dawn, one column
advancing up the right bank of the river, and the other up the left
bank, the latter with the object of taking the Heights of the Naffdach,
east of Tuz. The enemy had been reinforced during the night
by a battalion from Tauq, and was holding a front of 7 miles,
stretching from Yanhah-Buyuk to Tuz-Khurmatli, and at Tuz they
held a position covering the road and extending over the hills. At
daybreak the Hotchkiss-gun troop of ‘C’ Squadron opened fire
from the trenches on the right bank of the river, and soon came
under some pretty accurate shell-fire. Shortly after this B
Battery, of the 66th Brigade R.F.A., galloped up beside them and
opened up a heavy fire on the enemy’s position at about 6 <small>A.M.</small>,
the Infantry having deployed for the 2 main attacks on Tanijah
from the south-west, and on Tuz from the south. We were ordered
to withdraw and make a detour to the west. We circled behind the
battery to join up with the 21st and 22nd Cavalry and get across
the Tuz-Tauq road to cut off the Turks, who were already falling
back before our Infantry, who were advancing with steadiness under
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
machine-gun and artillery fire, right up to the guns which were in
action until they were within two hundred yards of them. Meanwhile
we were held up for a time by a nest of machine-guns some
1200 yards away on a small knoll. Two troops of the ‘B’ Squadron,
under Lt. MacDonald, were ordered out as a scout line. They
led off to the left of the knoll, and having got in line with it, wheeled
sharply to the right and charged the position in the rear and the
flank, all the enemy except two throwing up their hands to escape
being cut down. The taking of this knoll opened the way across
the plain, and we continued to advance, charging bodies of Turks
here and there, either killing them or taking them prisoners.
The largest body we found was between the Tauq road and the
hills, and these put up some resistance for a time until charged
from two sides by us and the 22nd Cavalry, the 21st Cavalry having
wheeled towards Tuz to deal with other bodies, who at that time
were shelling ‘A’ and ‘D’ Squadrons, commanded by Captain
Godfree. A number of the enemy made their way over the hills
and were harassed by our fire. Soon after this the fire of the
enemy died away, and by 9.30 <small>A.M.</small> all opposition had collapsed,
the whole position having fallen to us inside 4 hours with a very
slight loss. 1200 prisoners were taken, 25 machine-guns, and 12
field-guns that were in the position. The action having passed, we
rested for some time where we were, and on ‘A’ and ‘D’
Squadrons rejoining us in the afternoon we went into bivouac
opposite Tuz at about 3 <small>P.M.</small> We remained in bivouac here for five
days, during which we rested and grazed our horses. Whilst here,
our Brigade Commander received the following wire from General
Egerton: ‘Many congratulations to troops. Please convey my thanks
to General Caley and General Hollen-Prior for their good work,
and that of their officers and men. Cavalry charge must have been
magnificent. Please accept my repeated appreciation of the performances
of all ranks under your command.’ On the 5th May we
moved off at the head of the Brigade at 8 <small>A.M.</small>, and after crossing
the bridge of the Tauq-Chai at about 5 <small>P.M.</small>, we bivouacked for the
night some 2 miles north-west of it. We moved off again at
8.30 <small>A.M.</small> the following morning in the direction of Taza, when
shortly after our aeroplanes reported that the enemy had evacuated
their position there. On receiving this information we were ordered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
to advance to catch the retreating enemy at the village of Taza-Kharatli.
On arriving here at 11.30 <small>A.M.</small>, after crossing the Oazah
Chia on the Kirkuk road, we found the village unoccupied. Making
a short halt here we moved off again at 1.45 <small>P.M.</small>, marching on to
Kirkuk. The armoured cars, after having been towed through the
river, had preceded us along the Kirkuk road. At about 3.39 <small>P.M.</small>,
nearing Balban, we came under some shell-fire at long range, this
we avoided by making a detour to the east. After sending out
patrols, who were met by a very heavy fire, we galloped forward
and dismounted for action against the enemy holding the trenches
just outside Kirkuk. Finding the enemy so strongly entrenched,
we were unable to advance, but hotly engaged them until dusk,
when we were ordered to withdraw and form an outpost line about
3 miles from the town. This we did about 7 <small>P.M.</small>, when a
heavy storm broke out and very heavy rains continued to fall
throughout the night, which, combined with the intense cold,
made rest for us that night an impossibility. (The following names
appeared on the Order for the day for gallantry in action: Capt.
J. A. Jeffrey, Capt. A. M. Sassoon, Lt. J. J. Crystall, and R.S.M.
Seekins, all being awarded the M.C.) Our outpost line was formed
near Balban, on a track running east and west. The night was
fairly quiet, except for several loud explosions which occurred in
and near Kirkuk. The morning found the ground more or less a
quagmire, and at 6.30 <small>A.M.</small> we received orders to advance on the
town. ‘A’ Squadron moved off at 8 <small>A.M.</small>, followed by the Regiment
and the 21st Cavalry some half an hour later. No resistance was
encountered, and at 10.30 <small>A.M.</small> the Regiment entered the town,
‘C’ and ‘D’ Squadrons, under Capt. Godfree, moving on to
the high ground covering the north of the town. Several large
hospitals were found here, one containing 358 patients, the population
being in a starved condition. There were also several corpses
of Turkish soldiers horribly mutilated. This was said to have been
done by Arabs to avenge the raping of their women-folk. The
whole place was in a filthy condition. At 3 <small>P.M.</small> the Column moved
out of Kirkuk and bivouacked near Taziyan, some 3 miles down
the Taza road, a heavy storm breaking over us just as we were
pegging down our horses. Meanwhile ‘C’ and ‘D’ Squadrons
were sent forward to some hills some 4 miles north of the town
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
to harass the retreating enemy, and to protect our own main body
from attack. These two squadrons, after successfully hastening
the enemy’s retreat, reconnoitred the road to Yarvali, rejoining the
Column in bivouac about 5 <small>P.M.</small>, bringing with them 2 prisoners.
The Column remained in bivouac the following day, and at 12.30
<small>A.M.</small> we received orders to send 2 squadrons to reconnoitre the
northern road to Alton-Kupri as far as Sakizli, ‘B’ and ‘D’
Squadrons doing this commanded by Capt. Godfree. They were
also accompanied by a Company of the R.E.’s for the purpose of
destroying enemy shell-dumps which were known to be in the
vicinity. Two such dumps were located and destroyed near the
village of Daraman, and at Sakizli 7 large motor-lorries with
engines destroyed were found. These contained 2 mountain-guns,
2 machine-guns, and a large quantity of shell ammunition of various
sizes. At 5 <small>P.M.</small> orders were received by heliograph to proceed to
Yarvali and search it for any documents the enemy may have left.
Arriving there about 8 <small>P.M.</small>, we discovered a number of documents,
and also several aeroplane engines and drums of petrol, and a
quantity of shell ammunition. It being necessary to destroy this
material, the wing returned and bivouacked at 11 <small>P.M.</small> The
Column rested, and we grazed our horses all the following day,
and at 6 <small>A.M.</small> on the 10th May we marched on Alton-Kupri with
the intention of driving the enemy over the Lesser Zab river and
destroying the bridge there. We were preceded by 2 of our
armoured cars, who at about 11.15 <small>A.M.</small> were held up by the
enemy, who were in position on Guk-Tappah Hill, while the road
was shelled by the enemy’s batteries in Alton-Kupri. The armoured
cars succeeded in driving the enemy from Guk-Tappah, but were
quite unable to advance farther owing to a deep canal which
cut the road at this point. After observations had been made
from Guk-Tappah, the Regiment received orders to make an encircling
movement to the right, whilst the 21st Cavalry did the
same to the left. The 22nd Cavalry advancing in the centre
succeeded, by covered approaches, in getting within 2 miles of the
village which was on the farther side of the river. The Regiment
experienced considerable difficulty in advancing, owing to a considerable
number of very deep nullahs, which were full of water at
the time. The village was hidden from view by the high ground
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
on this side of the river. We advanced by wings ‘A’ and ‘B’
leading in extended order. After advancing about 1 mile we were
heavily shelled by mountain-guns, 14 pounders and 4.53, and considerable
rifle and machine-gun fire was opened on us by enemy
Infantry who were holding a series of trenches and rifle-pits on
this side of the river. The Regiment immediately dismounted
for action. The Hotchkiss-gun troop of ‘A’ Squadron moving
forward opened a very effective fire which was well supported by
our batteries. This proved too much for the enemy, who retired
to their second line of defence. On this side the Hotchkiss-gun
troop of ‘D’ Squadron advanced about 1000 yards with ‘C’
Hotchkiss-gun troop in support. Meanwhile ‘B’ Squadron
were endeavouring to get down to the river bank, but were unsuccessful
owing to the heavy rains and accurate firing of the
enemy’s batteries who were dug in on the opposite bank. We
continued to engage the enemy until about 6 <small>P.M.</small>, when orders
were received to withdraw to Daraman. During our retirement
the enemy shelled us with increased violence, and we sustained
several casualties, but luckily the number was small in comparison
with the terrific fire we were subjected to. One troop of ‘A’
Squadron was left near Guk-Tappah as escort to our casualties,
whilst we continued our march back till 10.45 <small>P.M.</small>, when we
bivouacked for the night. Orders were received the next morning
to return to Kirkuk. We did not move off until 2 <small>P.M.</small>, and
arrived at our previous bivouac near Kirkuk at about 6 <small>P.M.</small> The
following morning a strong patrol left bivouac at 7 <small>A.M.</small> to reconnoitre
a vast stretch of unexplored country between Taza and
Telabw-Shahanah, whilst the remainder of the Regiment, moving
off some half an hour later marched to Taza, some 9 miles distant,
where they went into bivouac. It was whilst here that a small,
but nevertheless fierce, caste riot broke out among the Indians who
had the handling of our transport. This necessitated the whole of
the Regiment having to turn out fully armed before it could be
quelled. At 5.30 <small>A.M.</small> the following morning, 13th May, the
Regiment commenced to march to Cemetery, where we were to join
the 7th Cavalry Brigade again. To reach the above place we now
had to cross some hitherto unexplored country, and so far not
having received any reports from our patrol which had left us the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
previous day to reconnoitre this part of the country, we had to
proceed with caution. Halting at about 10 <small>A.M.</small> to water and feed
our horses, we moved off again at 11.30 <small>A.M.</small> Meanwhile our
patrols had completed their reconnaissance, and got into communication
with us by helio, sending us a message to the effect
that an enemy column were rapidly disappearing into the hills.
The Regiment not being strong enough to intercept them, the
patrol was recalled and we continued our march, arriving at
Cemetery, and joined the 7th Cavalry Brigade at 8 <small>P.M.</small>, after
marching some 50 miles. Resting till 4 <small>P.M.</small> the following afternoon,
we moved through the Pass to Ain Nakhailah, some 4 miles
distant, bivouacking about 1 mile south of the salt springs there.
The following morning we continued our march on to Daur, which
was some 20 miles over a waterless desert. This proved a very
trying time for us, the little water which we were able to obtain
before leaving the springs being very brackish and salty, which,
combined with the intense [heat?], produced a thirst which was
well-nigh unendurable. These arduous marches, coming on the
top of our very recent hard fighting, tested our endurance to the
utmost, several of our men falling out of their saddles from sheer
weakness from want of food and rest. The sight of the river
Tigris had a noticeable and stimulating effect on both man and
horse, and on reaching the river both were jostling each other in
their frantic efforts to quench their burning thirst. On bivouacking
here many of us took the opportunity of having a much-needed dip
in the river. Our way now lay alongside the river, and owing to
the condition of both men and horses, it was decided to finish
our march by easy stages. Accordingly, at 4.30 <small>A.M.</small> the following
morning we trekked to Samarah, a distance of 12 miles, and
bivouacked some 2 miles north of the town. Moving off at the
same time the following morning to avoid the intense noonday
heat, we marched a farther 13 miles and bivouacked at Khan
Mifraji at 10.30 <small>A.M.</small> We trekked on to Akab, a distance of 15
miles, the following morning, crossing the pontoon bridge over the
river Adhaim, and bivouacked about a mile distant on the other
side. The morning after this, commencing at 5 <small>A.M.</small>, we did
another 17 miles on to Ktuwair, and went into bivouac there at
about 12 noon. From here we moved off at 4.30 <small>A.M.</small> and marched
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
to Baqubah, another 16 miles distant, where we arrived at about
11.30 <small>A.M.</small> Trekking a farther 12 miles the following day, we
bivouacked at Conningham’s Post at 10.30 <small>A.M.</small>; the following day,
the 22nd May, we again moved off at 4.30 <small>A.M.</small>, and covered the
remaining 16 miles to our summer camp at Chaldari, where we
arrived at about 11 <small>A.M.</small>, our strength on marching in being 19
officers, 315 other ranks, and 445 horses. On the morrow the
following was published in Regimental Orders: ‘The Commanding
Officer wishes to take the opportunity of expressing his keen
appreciation of the conduct of all ranks during the recent operations
on the north-eastern front which have so successfully
attained their object. During the course of these operations the
Regiment has encountered, apart from the enemy, many hardships
and difficulties, and it is the cheery spirit in which these hardships
have been met, and the constant courage with which these difficulties
have been overcome, that have elicited once more the
Commanding Officer’s admiration and pride.’</p>

<span class="large">THE AUTUMN OF 1918&mdash;LAST BATTLE WITH THE TURKS&mdash;CLOSE
OF THE WAR IN MESOPOTAMIA.</span></h2>

<p>The summer of 1918 having come to an end, the British army in
Mesopotamia prepared for another advance.</p>

<p>The general aspect of the Great War had by that time undergone
a sudden and promising change, for the Germans had failed
in their fierce offensive against the Allies on the Western Front,
Austria had shattered herself against their lines in Northern Italy,
and Bulgaria was firmly held by the Salonika force, while in Asia
the exhaustion of the Turks was now very evident. They had completely
failed to stop General Allenby’s victorious advance in
Palestine and Syria, and were hastily withdrawing troops from the
Persian frontier and the Caucasus. In Mesopotamia they were
still trying to show a bold front, but it seemed clear that they were
no longer in strength sufficient to withstand a determined attack
by the large and eager British army opposed to them.</p>

<p>“This, then,” says General Marshall, “seemed the moment to
take the offensive against the Turkish 6th Army, covering the
approaches to Mosul, and it was with great pleasure that on the
7th October I received orders to carry out this movement.”</p>

<p>The main body of the enemy’s troops, now reduced from long
fighting and other causes to about 9000 men with 59 guns, held a
formidable position astride the Tigris, at the Fatha Gorge&mdash;some
thirty-five miles above the British railhead at Tekrit. The position
had been thoroughly prepared for defence during the past eighteen
months, and was of great natural strength. The Turkish right
flank rested securely on two ranges of rugged hills which projected
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
into the waterless desert, and therefore could not be turned
by slow-moving Infantry. Their left extended for about five miles
along the crest of the Jebel Hamrin, and was strongly entrenched.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_292" src="images/i_292.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption small"><i>APPROXIMATE SKETCH OF RICHARDSONS BLUFF
POSITION</i></p></div>

<p>To attack such a position by direct advance up the Tigris was
a difficult matter, and General Marshall would have preferred to
move his main force by way of Kirkuk in the north-east, but this
was impossible. A large part of his transport had been taken
away by the operations in Northern Persia and the necessity for
collecting the harvest, so that there was not enough to subsist a
large body of troops at such a distance from the railway. The
only available route for the main force, therefore, was the line of
the Tigris, by which supplies could be pushed up, and this was
perforce the one selected. Even so there was only transport
enough to make mobile his Cavalry and half his Infantry.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_292fp" src="images/i_292fp.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption small">LT.-COL. T. T. RICHARDSON, D.S.O. SEPTEMBER 1918</p></div>

<p>The plan adopted was to work up the eastern bank of the river
and turn or force the enemy’s left. If that could be done, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
intention was to cut his line of retreat on Mosul by means of Cavalry
working round his left, and light-armoured motor-cars moving round
his right through the desert. A small column was sent up towards
Kirkuk under Brigadier-General Lewin to keep off any attack upon
the British right.</p>

<p>But the reduction of the Turkish position proved to be an easier
task than any one had expected. On the night of the 23rd October,
when all was ready for the general attack on the Fatha Gorge, a
British column pushed along the crest of the Jebel Hamrin against
the enemy’s left, while the 7th Cavalry Brigade, to which the
Thirteenth had now returned, moved round the north of the range.
“The vigorous action of these two columns,” says General Marshall,
“caused the Turks to abandon the very strong Fatha position before
daylight,” and to retreat up-stream.</p>

<p>Then followed some days of manœuvring and fighting, the
Infantry pressing steadily upon the retreating Turks in spite of great
difficulties, for the enemy had destroyed the road through the hills
on both banks of the river, and a Brigade of Cavalry under General
Cassels trying to work round into the enemy’s rear. In this attempt
the Cavalry were successful. Moving wide of the Tigris, they rode
right round the enemy’s left, and on the 26th October, coming back
to the river, they struck a ford opposite Hadraniya, fifteen miles
above Shergat, the point where the Turks intended to make their
real stand. This movement was masked by the other Brigade, the
7th, under Brigadier-General Norton, who demonstrated on the line
of the Tigris.</p>

<p>The Hadraniya ford was a bad one, for it crossed three channels
of the river, one of which was nearly five feet deep, with a strong
current; but Cassels got his regiments over, and, directly he had
done so, sent one of them at a gallop to seize an important gorge
five miles down stream, between him and the Turks, who were
retreating upon him. By the morning of the 27th October the bulk
of the Brigade had taken up a strong position blocking the road to
Mosul, and it had been joined by the light motor-cars, which had
got round through the desert.</p>

<p>It was a daring move, for Cassels had only three weak regiments
of Cavalry and a battery of Horse Artillery, while below him was
the retreating Turkish force, and above him to the north an unknown
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
number of Turkish reinforcements from Mosul coming down to join
it. But this was the one chance of capturing the main body of the
enemy, and the Brigade meant to hold its position at all costs until
supported.</p>

<p>For the next two days, the 27th and 28th October, Cassels was
in serious danger, for though to conceal his weakness he boldly
attacked, he was soon attacked himself from the south by a very
superior force of Infantry and guns, which made repeated attempts
to break through, while the Turkish reinforcements from Mosul
moved against his rear. But though hard pressed he managed to
hold his ground, and on the afternoon and evening of the second
day support began to arrive. First came a battalion of Infantry
which had made a forced march of thirty-three miles from the
eastward, and then after dark the 7th Cavalry Brigade, which after
a march of forty-three miles crossed the Tigris by the difficult
Hadraniya Ford. In doing so they lost several men and horses
drowned, but their arrival made all the difference. Cassels was now
too strong to be easily overwhelmed.</p>

<p>Still the position was critical, for the main body of the Turks,
though retreating, had not been beaten, and the British troops were
nearly worn out. The Infantry “had been marching and fighting
for four days under most arduous conditions,” while Cassels and his
own Cavalry Brigade had been continuously in action for seventy-two
hours, and all the force now at his disposal had made long marches.
But if the Turkish force was to be held, there must be no rest for
the troops, in spite of exhaustion and darkness, for the enemy saw
that he was trapped, and would be sure to fight desperately for
freedom.</p>

<p>He certainly did so. During the night of the 28th he tried again
and again to break out northwards, and though he did not succeed,
he fought on all through the 29th, and all through the night that
followed; and some of his counter-attacks against the British
Infantry who were pressing him from the south were by no means
easily stopped. It was a splendid defence, and rightly called forth
the admiration of his assailants.</p>

<p>The end of the battle may best be told in General Marshall’s
words:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Meanwhile a serious threat from Turkish reinforcements (5th
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
Division troops) moving down from the Mosul direction developed
against Cassels’ right flank. These troops established themselves
with guns and machine-guns on the high bluffs near Hadraniya,
but were promptly dealt with by the 7th Cavalry Brigade. The
Thirteenth Hussars galloped across the open, dismounted under the
bluffs, and, led by their Colonel, carried the position by assault,
many Turks being accounted for with the bayonet.</p>

<p>“Mounted pursuit by the remainder of the 7th Cavalry Brigade
cleared away further menace from the north, and resulted in the
capture of 1000 prisoners, with 2 guns and 12 machine-guns.</p>

<p>“The enemy’s avenues of escape northwards were now effectively
blocked, thanks to the skilful and resolute handling of his detachment
by General Cassels, and the firm determination of his troops, who
repulsed every attempt by the enemy to break through.</p>

<p>“Gripped as in a vice, with his men packed in ravines which were
raked by our guns from across the Tigris, Ismail Hakki, the Turkish
Commander, found himself in a hopeless position. All attempts to
break through had failed, communication with the Turkish Commander-in-Chief
at Mosul had been rendered impossible, and no
relief was in sight. At dawn on October 30th, just as our
troops were about to renew the attack, white flags appeared all
along the Turkish lines, and later on Ismail Hakki surrendered
in person.”</p>

<p>So ended the last battle fought in the Great War by a Turkish
army. It had been gallantly contested, but the victory was as
complete as a victory could be. The Turkish 6th Army had been
not only defeated but captured.</p>

<p>Immediately after the surrender, the 7th Cavalry Brigade and
armoured cars pushed rapidly along the Mosul road and made a
considerable addition to the number of prisoners. The 14th
(Indian) Lancers, charging with the lance, captured a convoy and
500 men, while the 13th Lancers captured a Turkish battalion.
Altogether the Turks lost on the 30th October over 11,000 prisoners
and 51 guns, besides great quantities of machine-guns, animals,
and military material of all kinds.</p>

<p>By the first of November both Cavalry Brigades had got within
twelve miles of Mosul, when they were met by a flag of truce
informing them that an armistice had been concluded between Great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
Britain and Turkey. Hostilities ceased, and the long campaign in
Mesopotamia had closed with a dramatic success.</p>

<p>At Shergat, as elsewhere, the bulk of the close fighting had
of course been done by the Infantry, but General Marshall reported
that “the daring and brilliant leadership of the Cavalry Brigades
under Brigadier-Generals Cassels and Norton contributed largely
to the final result,” and it may safely be affirmed that no Regiment
in those Brigades had more right to be proud of its share in the
work than the Thirteenth Hussars.</p>

<p>The extracts appended give details of its movements during the
last period of the campaign, and especially of the affair at
“Richardson’s Bluff,” as the scene of the fight at Hadraniya came
to be called.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="caption"><i>Account by General Norton, commanding 7th Brigade.</i></p>

<p>“The Brigade left Fathah at one o’clock on the night of the 27th-28th
October, crossed the Lesser Zab at about 8 <small>A.M.</small>, and reached the
Hadrani-Yah Ford over the Tigris at 4.30 <small>P.M.</small> on the 28th, having
marched about 50 miles since 1 <small>A.M.</small>, the last 30 under a very hot
sun, and about 70 miles in the last 36 hours.</p>

<p>“The leading Regiment (13th Lancers) immediately commenced
to cross to the right bank, and got over without accident, but
as the ford was a difficult one, there was considerable delay, and,
by the time it came to the turn of the 13th Hussars, it was
practically dark. The ford, which had been difficult in daylight,
became positively dangerous after dusk, and a number of men,
particularly those leading pack-horses, got into difficulties, and were
carried down-stream. Hampered as they were by their ammunition
and other equipment, their situation was a very precarious one, but
most of them fortunately managed to scramble out on one bank or
the other.</p>

<p>“When the roll was eventually called, it was found that three
men, viz.:&mdash;</p>

  </tr></table>

<p>and two horses, were missing. With the exception of Private
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
Newman, whose dead body was found by the Infantry several days
later some distance down-stream, no trace of these men has ever
been found.</p>

<p>“In the whole Brigade, 21 men were carried away by the strong
current, and drowned while crossing this ford.</p>

<p>“Only three squadrons of the Regiment crossed on this night,
the remaining squadron (‘A’ Squadron, under Lieutenant H. C. D.
FitzGibbon, M.C.) being ordered to remain on the left bank as
escort to the Battery, which could not be got across in the dark.</p>

<p>“The Brigade, less the battery, this squadron, and the 13th
D.C. Lancers, bivouacked on the river bank; the 13th Lancers,
as soon as they were across, had been sent forward to support
the right of the 11th Brigade, which was occupying a ridge of
hills S.W. of the ford, parallel to the river, and about 3000 yards
away from it.</p>

<p>“The night passed without incident, although there was a considerable
amount of firing from the position occupied by the 11th
Brigade and the 13th D.C. Lancers.</p>

<p>“Before daybreak on the 29th, the Brigade was moved into a
covered position under the river bank, and orders were issued for
the battery and the remaining squadron of the 13th Hussars
to cross to the right bank as soon as there was sufficient daylight.</p>

<p>“The moment the squadron commenced to cross, the Turks
shelled the ford heavily and accurately from 2 guns on high ground
about 3000 yards to the N.W.</p>

<p>“The squadron managed to get across, fortunately without
casualties, but it was obviously impossible for the battery to do so
until the hostile fire had been subdued.</p>

<p>“About 7 <small>A.M.</small>, V Battery, R.H.A., came into action on the
left bank, and the Turks shortly afterwards withdrew their guns.</p>

<p>“About this time a squadron of the 13th D.C. Lancers, which
had been ordered to push up the Mosul road at daybreak,
encountered heavy shell and M.G. fire, and was compelled to fall
back to the Cemetery, where it held its own with difficulty.</p>

<p>“It was clear now that the enemy were holding the high ground
to the N.W. in considerable force, and did not consist, as reported
by aero reconnaissances, of merely a few scattered groups of
Infantry.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span></p>

<p>“Their position was on a range of hills approximately parallel to
the river, and at about 3000 yards from it. At the southern extremity
of this range was a high bluff, which will be referred to as Hadraniyah
Bluff. Farther to the south again was the range held by the 11th
Brigade and 13th D.C. Lancers, and between Hadraniyah Bluff
and the river, and some 1000 yards to the S.E. of the former, was
a fair-sized isolated hill on which was a Mahomedan cemetery.</p>

<p>“After a personal reconnaissance of the position, so far as was
possible, the Brigadier at 8.15 <small>A.M.</small> issued orders for the 13th
Hussars, supported by the 24th Jat Lancers, and covered by the
fire of V Battery, R.H.A., from across the river, and the Vickers
guns, a subsection of which was now in action on the Cemetery
Hill, to gallop across the open from their covered position near the
river, dismount under the Bluff, and carry the position by a dismounted
attack.</p>

<p>“It should be explained that the contour of the hill made it
obvious, that unless the Turks came out of their trenches, which
were none too well sited, and advanced a short distance down the
hill, there must be a considerable amount of dead ground at the
foot of the slope, which would give cover to the horses, and enable
the troops to form for the dismounted attack. It was hoped that
the gun-fire would make it impossible for the Turks to leave their
trenches for the purpose of covering this dead ground.</p>

<p>“On debouching from their covered position on the river bank,
in accordance with the above orders, the leading squadron at once
came under a hot fire from the Turkish machine-guns on the hill,
and the squadron leader (Captain Evans, 21st Lancers) fell severely
wounded.</p>

<p>“This caused the squadron to lose its direction: it inclined
slightly to its left, and halted under the cover of Cemetery Hill.</p>

<p>“The remaining squadrons followed it, and eventually the whole
Regiment was concentrated behind this hill.</p>

<p>“By this time, it was clear that the guns had not yet succeeded
in subduing the Turkish fire, and the further prosecution of the
attack was held up to allow a further artillery preparation.</p>

<p>“Brigade Headquarters was now on Cemetery Hill, and the
F.O.O. of the Battery was also established there with his signallers.</p>

<p>“About this time&mdash;viz., 10 <small>A.M.</small>&mdash;a Field Battery, No. A/33, R.F.A.,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
having crossed the ford, was placed at the disposal of the Brigadier,
and came into action some 2000 yards to the S.E. of Cemetery
Hill.</p>

<p>“At 12.30 <small>P.M.</small> the Brigadier personally gave orders to Lieut.-Colonel
Richardson to renew the attack on the Bluff at 1.20 <small>P.M.</small>,
and detailed arrangements were made for the attack to be closely
supported by both Batteries and all available Vickers guns.</p>

<p>“In accordance with these orders, the Regiment, in column of
wings with extended files, debouched from under cover of Cemetery
Hill, and galloped straight for the Bluff. The ground was flat and
open, the only obstacle being a rather deep dry nullah about half-way,
which caused a little crowding and delay. The moment the
leading squadron debouched, the Turks opened a heavy fire with
all their machine-guns, but the accurate fire of our two batteries
and the Vickers guns made it impossible for them to leave their
trenches, and the squadrons soon got into the dead ground under
the Bluff.</p>

<p>“During this phase of the attack, although these galloping
squadrons were absolutely exposed for at least 500 yards to the
fire of 12 machine-guns and 1000 Infantry, at ranges from 1500 to
500 yards, not a single man was hit, and only one or two horses.</p>

<p>“Had the Turks put down a machine-gun barrage on some point,
such as the afore-mentioned nullah, and kept it there, our casualties
must have been considerable; but they were evidently disconcerted
by the heavy shelling, and there appeared to be no central control,
each machine-gunner firing as he pleased.</p>

<p>“Having reached the foot of the Bluff, the Hussars lost no time
in dismounting and forming for attack. Having fixed bayonets,
they swarmed up the almost precipitous hill, gallantly led by their
Commanding Officer.</p>

<p>“All this time, both batteries, using ‘gun-fire,’ were bursting
their shells with beautiful accuracy along the crest of the Hill,
and the Vickers guns were also keeping up a heavy fire on the
trenches.</p>

<p>“This barrage did not lift until the Hussars were within a few
yards of the crest, and there is no doubt that the splendid accuracy
and rapidity of fire of these guns was a most important factor in
making the attack the success it was.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span></p>

<p>“From Brigade Headquarters on Cemetery Hill, it was clear that
the Turks in the trenches, having seen the squadrons moving towards
them at a gallop, and being unable to see what was happening at
the foot of the hill, were becoming anxious. Individual men and
small parties could be seen getting out of the advanced trenches
and moving to the rear, many being caught by the barrage as they
did so.</p>

<p>“As the barrage lifted, the Hussars, still led by their Colonel,
charged over the crest, shot or bayoneted such Turks as still confronted
them in the trenches, and then rapidly forming line to the
right, swept along the crest to deal with the Turks who were still
holding their position at the north end of the hill.</p>

<p>“As soon as the Hussars’ attack had gained the crest, the 13th
D.C. and 14th Jat Lancers quickly mounted, and galloped round
to the west and north, captured the enemy’s two guns, and cut off
the retreat of the Infantry retiring before the attack of the 13th
Hussars.</p>

<p>“Seeing their retreat entirely cut off, the whole Turkish force
surrendered.</p>

<p>“In this successful operation, 2 mountain-guns, 12 machine-guns,
and 982 unwounded prisoners were taken, and there was a considerable
number of Turkish dead and wounded on the hill.</p>

<p>“This enemy force consisted of the whole of the 13th Regiment
which had been sent from the 5th Division in Persia to reinforce
the army of Haqi Bey.”</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear General</span>,&mdash;I must send you a line to tell you of
another fine performance by the Regiment&mdash;a performance which
our Brigadier (Gen. Charles Norton), the Commanding Officers of
the other Regiments of the Brigade, and other eye-witnesses describe
to me as the finest thing they have ever seen. I myself agree that
not only as a spectacle but in its complete and immediate success
it is the finest performance put up by the Regiment during the war,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
but as a test of discipline and tenacity I would place Lajj first:
there we were on the verge of annihilation, and yet managed to put
up a fighting front to the enemy; here it is true we were foiled in
our first attempt, but the sqdns. reached cover in perfect order,
and the failure of the early morning only made them the keener to
score in the afternoon. I enclose a copy of the dry sober account
of the day, which I made in my note-book two days after the occurrence,
so I will only give you here a brief outline of the events which
led up to our being where we were, and of the few days after the
29th which led us to the occupation of Mosul.</p>

<p>“Since an armistice, in the nature of a complete military surrender
by Turkey, has been arranged and signed, I hardly suppose that the
censor will seriously object to numbers of Brigades and Divisions
being given, but I will not risk more deletion than is necessary for
the tale.</p>

<p>“Well, the original objective was the reduction of the Fathah
position&mdash;a very strong natural position formed by the passage of
the Tigris through the range of hills known on the left bank as the
Jebel Hamrin and on the right bank as Jebel Makhul&mdash;about thirty
miles N. of Tekrit, held on both banks by some 3000 rifles and 40
guns. Two Cavalry Bgds., ours and Cassels’, had made a long
turning movement over the Hamrin, and were in position to the
N. and N.E. of the Turkish position by dawn of day, and our
feelings were rather mixed when we learnt about 8 <small>A.M.</small> that Johnny
Turk had evacuated the position a day or two earlier, and retired
mostly along the main road to Mosul on the right bank, which ran
through a series of strong natural defensive positions against which
the Infantry could make only slow progress against the Turk, who
is a past-master in the art of rearguard fighting: so obstinate was
he in holding on to a position opposite the confluence of the Lesser
Zab river with the Tigris that we were hurried one night to the
Fathah Gorge, which we bridged with a pontoon, to go up the
right bank and create a diversion in favour of our Infantry; on
arriving at Fathah, however, the position had changed&mdash;the Turk
had retired, and we were no longer required on the right bank; but
in the meantime Cassels’ Bgde. had crossed the Tigris some twenty-five
miles north of the Lesser Zab, and had taken up a position
astride the line of retreat of the Turks, and reinforcements to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
latter were said to be closing on Cassels’ rear, so after a few hours’
halt we were hurried back to the Zab and beyond it to the ford,
which we reached at dusk on the 28th, having covered 40 miles
since 1 <small>A.M.</small> that day. The ford was deep and unmarked; I was
riding my biggest horse, and the water was over my knees; on
many men it was up to the waist, and we were unfortunate in losing
three men, of whom no trace could be found in the dark.</p>

<p>“The events of the 29th I have described in the attached account.
The Bgde. that night (29th) bivouacked on its fighting ground, and
next morning moved S.W. to a position on Cassels’ right, where
about 10 a.m. we learnt that the Turks caught between the Infantry
and Cassels had surrendered: we therefore turned our heads northward,
and about 2.30 <small>P.M.</small> came up with the Turkish rearguard,
who surrendered after a few rounds from the battery, and the 13th
Lancers pursuing brought back a lot more, making the total captures
of the Bgde. up to about 2500 for the two days.</p>

<p>“Next day we continued our advance northward toward Mosul,
but about 11 <small>A.M.</small> met Turkish envoys in a car, who came to tell us
that an armistice had been signed.</p>

<p>“We have been on half rations or less for many days, and hardly
get a scrap of outside news, but these days must be fraught with
intense interest and excitement at home, and these details must in
comparison fade into insignificance; but, hereafter, they will be of
interest to all concerned with the Regiment, so I will not labour
at further excuses for writing.”</p>

<p>“The night of the 28th-29th passed rather cheerlessly, most of
the men having got wet to the waist, and in many cases their
blankets and warm coats also having been soaked in fording the
river the previous evening, and before dawn we moved down under
cover of the river bank, where we were practically immune from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
shell-fire which was opened on us soon after daylight and continued
until about 7 <small>A.M.</small> About this time I received orders to gallop the
Regiment and get a footing on a plateau rising almost sheer from
the plain, on which several emplacements could be seen. I
asked for and got the co-operation of V Battery, which put a
strong barrage on the plateau from 8 <small>A.M.</small> to 8.15 <small>A.M.</small>, at which
hour we emerged from the river bank, supported on either flank by
a subsection of 18 M.G.’s, commanded respectively by Lt. Noel
and Lt. Foley. The following is a rough sketch showing disposition
of Regiment and ground to be covered.</p>

<p>“As the Regiment reached the open, the four squadrons took up
a diamond formation&mdash;‘B’ Squadron under Capt. Evans, 21st
Lancers, leading, ‘C’ on left flank, ‘D’ on right flank, and ‘A’
Squadron (Lt. Fitzgibbon) bringing up the rear. I rode in the
centre, and on either flank were the Hotchkiss guns of two squadrons
co-operating with the subsection of machine-guns&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, ‘B’ and
‘D’ on right, under Lt. Parkes, and ‘A’ and ‘C’ on left, under
Lt. Hartigan, M.C.</p>

<p>“As soon as the Regiment came into sight in the open a very
hot fire from M.G.’s, rifles, and camel guns (9-pounders) was opened
on it, and when about 1000 yds. from its objective, Capt. Evans
was very seriously wounded, and the troop leaders of the Leading
Squadron led their troops to the cover of the Cemetery Hill, where
the remainder of the Regiment quickly concentrated. I quite agreed
with their action at the time, and looking back two days afterwards
with the knowledge gained since, I am convinced that it was the
right course to take. The crest of the plateau was very much more
strongly held than had ever been anticipated, and sufficient time
had not been allowed for the artillery barrage.</p>

<p>“We occupied the Cemetery Hill and tried to gain ground to the
west, but the glacis was quite bare and exposed to M.G. fire from
the plateau and from trenches to the west. The Brigadier visited
us about 11.30 <small>A.M.</small>, and I suggested to him that we should try again
to get the hill if the artillery would plaster the plateau and the
known trenches until we had gained a footing on the crest. This
they did with great effect at intervals until 1.30 <small>P.M.</small>, at which time
I led the Regiment from the cover of Cemetery Hill in two waves,
‘A’ and ‘D’ Squadrons (Mr Fitzgibbon and Capt. Jeffrey, M.C.)
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
in the first, and ‘C’ (Mr Norton) and ‘B’ (Capt. Howey) in the
second under Capt. Godfree.</p>

<p>“The first wave reached the foot of the bluff with only one
casualty, a man whose horse fell in jumping a deepish nullah which
lay across part of our course&mdash;dismounted to climb the almost precipitous
cliff-side, the footing on which was made the worse by the
loose rolling gravel surface; how the men scaled that cliff carrying
their Hotchkiss guns and ammunition-bags will always remain a
marvel to me.</p>

<p>“Meantime the second wave had reached the hill, also without
casualties, and taken position on the right of the first. As we
appeared on the crest fire broke on us from all sides, but the <i>moral</i>
of the Turks had been so severely shaken by the Artillery that our
casualties were very slight, and by bringing our right forward we
were soon able to bring enfilade fire on the trenches to our front,
and about 1.45 the first white flag was hoisted. The other trenches
did not take long to follow their example, and in less than half an
hour after leaving Cemetery Hill we were in complete possession
of the plateau, and prisoners, whose numbers eventually mounted
to 722, were being marched in batches from every side to a central
spot. A few undoubtedly escaped, but the Indian Cavalry Regiments
took up the pursuit and brought back 200 or 300 and a camel gun.
The booty in arms was very large, at least 20 machine-guns and
several thousands of rounds being taken.</p>

<p>“Our casualties were one, Sergt. Holloway, killed, and the following
N.C.O.’s and men wounded&mdash;viz., Sergt. Barnard, Cpls. Vinall
and Hill, Ptes. Little, Patrick, and Tranter (Cpl. Vinall has since
died of wounds).</p>

<p>“Sergt. Leeman had been killed with the following wounded
whilst we were on Cemetery Hill: 2nd Lt. Russell, Ptes. Powell,
Gerrard, and Winter.</p>

<p>“Pte. Harvey was wounded by shell-fire at the ford early in the
morning, and the following were drowned whilst crossing the river
on the previous evening&mdash;viz., L.-Cpl. Bartlett, Ptes. Newman
and Donoghue.</p>

<p>“It transpired later that the Turkish troops opposed to us on
the Bluff were the three Battns. of the 13th Regiment who
had recently come down from Lake Urmia to reinforce the troops
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
on the Fathah position, and that they were preparing to attack the
ford at 4 <small>P.M.</small> that afternoon, when our assault destroyed their

<p>“The fight was short and sharp and the victory complete; we
owed our almost complete immunity from loss to the excellent
shooting of V Battery and A 337, and it was, I must admit,
some consolation to know that the troops which brought off the
coup were all British.”</p>

<p>“A batch of honours of which any Regiment may well be proud,
as I think you will agree; and indeed we are all very proud of
them, and myself not the least proud!</p>

<p>“We were pushed off here with 2 guns of V Battery and a
subsection of M.G. at short notice on Monday last to stop reported
rioting by retiring Turks and to see them over the border, which is
only some 7 or 8 miles from here, and we did the 75 miles in 31
hours. The Turks had heard of our coming and quitted&mdash;very

M.E.F.,<br />

</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Mr and Mrs Wallace</span>,&mdash;It is with a sad heart, and with
the deepest sympathy, that I write to you of Jim’s presumed death.
Jim and I were staunch friends together ever since we were in
France, and shared one another’s hardships and joys all the way
through. Some time back ‘A’ Section was split up; Jim went to
‘C’ and I to ‘B,’ so at the actual time of crossing the river
(Tigris) we were apart, as my section was about one hundred yards
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
in front. From 12 midnight the night previous to crossing, we
had been marching, and crossed at 6.30 <small>P.M.</small> the following evening,
and during that period we had covered a distance of 57 miles,
which was a pretty stiff march, and men and horses were feeling a
bit done up. When we got in the water some of the horses were
restless and started plunging and rearing. This is what happened
to Jim: I learnt it from men who were near him at the time. His
horse reared and Jim came off. The current of the river was very
swift at the time, and it was also dark. We have lost four men in
the squadron in the same way, and nothing has been heard of any
of them since. The next morning we got into action! The
13th Hussars formed line and charged up a hill at the Turks.
The hill was too steep to get up, so when they got half-way up
they did a dismounted action, and within a quarter of an hour the
Turks on the top of the hill showed the white flag, and over one
thousand surrendered; by late in the afternoon the 7th Cavalry
Brigade had beat the whole of that force, capturing nearly three
thousand prisoners. The finest piece of work the Brigade has
done during the war. I am sure poor Jim would have delighted
in it. We then proceeded on towards Mosul, and came in contact
with, and captured, two hundred and fifty reinforcements with
7 machine-guns and some big guns. Towards the evening, with
one Regiment of Indians (14th Lancers) and one section of 16th
Squadron M.G.C., we overtook and captured between two and
three miles of convoy and thirteen hundred prisoners. We are now
in Mosul. When about 20 miles from Mosul an aeroplane dropped
a message which said that the Turks had surrendered Mosul, and
that hostilities with Turkey had ceased. Jim has left behind him
a memory which one can never forget. Loved and respected by
all who knew him, as he was always ready to offer his help and
sympathy to any one in trouble. And you have cause to be proud
of having had a son who kept up the traditions of a Britisher to
its highest level, and was a true and noble soldier to the core.
You might please write to Mr Justice Eve and let him know, as I
am sure that Jim would wish it, as he held his late squadron leader,
Capt. Eve, 13th Hussars, in the highest esteem, and I know that a
short time ago Jim wrote to Mr Justice Eve thanking him for the
photo. I hope that Jim’s brother who was wounded has quite
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
recovered by now. Well, bear up, and try and look on it for the
best, as I know that all your trouble has come in a heap lately.
I unfortunately lost my mother in an air-raid since I have been
out here.&mdash;From Jim’s old Chum, 56799, <span class="smcap">George Costello</span>.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Lizzie</span>,&mdash;I don’t know how to start answering your
letters&mdash;I have received that many from you for the last 4 days;
they all came of a rush, the reason of it was they were in the
country, and could not reach us on account of the shortage of
transport....</p>

<p>“Well, we had some hard fighting for about a fortnight, but we
managed to get round them and capture the lot; we were very
lucky, for they nearly captured us instead, but we managed to get
a good mounted charge in on them, and that was the turning-point
of our last battle out here. Our Regt. alone captured 1300
prisoners, but it was a good job they did surrender to us, for they
could have wiped out every man of us if we fought on, because our
Regt. was not near up to strength: we lost a good many. It was
hard lines on them, for it was our last fight; they surrendered
Mosul to us the next day, and a good job too, for we were about
done; we went 2 and 3 days at a time with no rations except
a pound of dry flour per man, and you may know what a big feed
one can get out of a pound of flour (I don’t think), and that flour
was ground barley. You would laugh to see us cooking it: we used
to get a bit of tin, make a fire under it, then mix the flour up with
some water into a dough, then roll it out into little flat cakes and
put it on a tin and bake it, so you may know what nice bread it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
was (I don’t think), but still I was glad of it; they kept us going
all right, and even now, although we are in Mosul, all we are living
on is what we buy off the inhabitants, but of course everything will
come right again as soon as we get settled down a bit. We were
within 15 miles of Mosul when word came through that they had
surrendered the place, so we stopped where we were until next
day, and then news came through that Turkey had packed up
altogether; it was taken very quietly, every one was that fed up, not
even a cheer was given. Then we marched into the City and took
over all that was there: they had plenty of stuff&mdash;food, guns, and
men: it seemed so strange we were fighting them a few hours
before, and then all that was to be seen was our officers and their
officers shaking hands and making much of one another; but it
wasn’t so in the case of the men&mdash;if our fellows had their way they
would have been scrapping them, for we haven’t forgotten some of
the tricks they done to our fellows; but still, thank God! it is all
over. Well, we had been in Mosul for about a week when the
news came through of Germany packing up: even that was taken
very quietly, for it was raining as hard as it could, and we didn’t
have a bit of shelter, so the only remarks that were passed was, it’s
a bloody good job it’s over; so that is how we enjoyed the good
news: of course every one was delighted but didn’t show it. Well,
Lizzie, you will think I have gone mad on the war, so I will
change the subject. I don’t know if you have heard much about
Mosul or not; well, it is supposed to be one of the great Sacred
Cities out here&mdash;they say it’s mentioned several times in the Bible
(but as I don’t know much about the Bible I cannot say); it is
much the same as Baghdad, but a little more up to date: there is a
couple of Catholic Chapels here; of course all Armenians are
Catholics, and besides, there is some French here too, but give me
one corner of Accrington and they can keep all this country.
Just outside Mosul is the ruins of Ninevah, the great city in olden
days that was swallowed up by the great earthquake: it is a big
mound now, but there is big holes made in it that a man can
crawl through, and you can see the ruins of the City beneath: I
have been in them many a time, for we find Guards on it every
day; so that is how we pass the time away going through it. If
you ask one of the Priests they may be able to tell you about it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
(but I shall be glad to see the back of it). The climate up here
is just like England&mdash;in fact it feels colder to me: it has rained
ever since we’ve been here, and I can tell you it’s none too
comfortable, for all we’ve got is one blanket and no other shelter
of any kind. Well, Lizzie, it’s time now I came to thank you for
all the trouble I have put you to; first of all, I don’t know how
to thank you for getting me that Roll of Honour, as you say it is
a nice thing, but the reason I wanted it mostly was because I
had a good few mates who were on there. God rest them! Mr
Rolfe was my Troop Officer, he led us in the charge, and the
Turk that killed him was also killed by one of our fellows, so that
was one consolation; if you look on there you will see Private
Stones’ name; he came from Whally. Pte. M‘Nulty came from
Birkenhead, Pte. Cole from Halifax, and Tpr. Spicer from Dublin:
he was only about 18 years old. I shall tell you all about them
when I go to see you at No. 41. It was very kind of Mr Eve for
writing such a nice letter; his son was a nice fellow and a fine
leader. I seen him get killed, he was shot right through the head.
It was good of you getting them framed. Again I thank you from
the bottom of my heart. Now I must thank you for sending
Xmas card, and above all, I was most delighted at getting poor
Dan’s Memory Card. God rest his soul. It’s the only thing that
grieves me, is he did not live so as to have the pleasure of meeting
him again. I was always looking forward to having a good time
with him if both of us had the luck, but as you say God knows
best.”</p>

“<span class="smcap">Field.</span></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Olive</span>,&mdash;Well, my goodness, a lot of things have
happened since my last letter to you. Peace! what an extraordinary
word: it is hard to believe the whole thing is over. I will try and
tell you all since my last letter.</p>

<p>“The Brigade was in its summer camp, just a few miles north of
Baghdad, when I got back from leave. You remember I sent you a
word saying we were going out once more. The idea was to take
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
the Fahta position. The Turkish forces were then holding the gorge
where the Tigris runs through the Jebel Hamrin. It was supposed,
and is, a very strong position, with a desert on one side and a
range of hills on the other. He, however, did not hold all the passes,
enabling us (the Cavalry) to get over and behind his position. We
night-marched round, and at dawn attacked, but to find he did not
like the look of the thing and had gone in the night. We next met
him on a rather strong position he had taken up on the Lesser Zab.
He held us up there for about three days, and started to retreat on
Mosul. We, or rather Cassels and his Brigade (with the 7th
Hussars) were rather too quick for him, and had got between him
and Mosul, dug themselves in, and held them up. A most gallant
performance. We were then hurried up to reinforce him as he was
not strong enough for the job, and would undoubtedly have failed
had we not come up. Two days after we had the lot prisoners,
about 10,000. My Regiment had rather a fine chance. About 900
Turks were holding a fairly strong position on some hills with a
very large field of fire in front of them. We got Archies to clear
up that position. The only way to do it was mounted at the gallop
over the open and dismount under the crest of the hills. We formed
up in two lines, Jeffrey’s and my squadrons in the first line and the
other two in the rear, and off we went. Those who saw it said it
was as fine a show as they had ever seen. The line was as good
as on parade. We crossed the open at full gallop, dismounted under
the crest, fixed bayonets, and before you could say knife had a good
footing on the crest. The whole thing was so quick that the Turk
was rather taken unawares, and we had cleared up the whole position
and taken the lot in no time. My squadron at the time, the same
as the others, was only sixty strong&mdash;that is to say, about 40
dismounted men. The Colonel led the first line himself, and got a
bar to his D.S.O. for it&mdash;not bad!!!</p>

<p>“After that we were hurried up the Mosul road. We took another
1800 prisoners, reached a place called Hammam Ali about 15
miles south of Mosul, and for the first time heard of the Turkish
Armistice. I then had a rather interesting time, as I went into
Mosul with General Cassels to interview the Turkish Commander.
It was rather a unique experience, the whole thing in French. To
cut a long story short, they were obliged by the terms to evacuate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
the Mosul Villayat. We marched into the town, a very dirty but
rather interesting place. A lot of people speak French. We were
camped outside with very few tents and a very wet and cold climate,
and no warm clothes to put on. The Regiment was then detailed
to send a squadron up to a place on the border called Zakho, about
80 miles north of Mosul, to keep order, and here I am Lord and
Master of my little Kingdom.</p>

<p>“It is rather funny being so far away from everybody, but rather
nice in a way. I have got two officers with me, Stirling and Hartigan.
The first you know of, and the other, also, is one of the best.
We are living for the first time for 2&frac12; years in a house, not
a bad one at all, and even my men have got them into a large
building, so on the whole we are rather comfy. It is very pretty;
the village is in a beautifully fertile valley, with high snow-capped
mountains in front of me. Plenty to eat and lovely <i>water</i> to drink,
and so good for one!!! and I am the Lord and Master of the district.
We are well out of Mesopot, and well into Kurdistan. Kurdish is an
extraordinary language, but quite a lot of people speak French. Their
dress is quite pretty, in a way rather like the Dutch with big trousers.
The day before I left Mosul, news came in that Germany had thrown
in. It was early in the morning, we were in a very small tent; I
was shaving at the time: it was received with great calm and
indifference. News came in later the same day that owing to the
rain carts could not get up to us, and we were put on half rations.
Less indifference was shown to this bit of news.</p>

<p>“I can’t send this letter for a day or two, so will go on with it
to-morrow. Me voila encore une fois!...</p>

<p>“It is extraordinary to think war is over! though I am afraid it
will be a long time before they let us all go. What a lot of mothers
and wives must be thankful. I suppose the sights at home must have
been wonderful.</p>

<p>“I had a very interesting time yesterday. The mine only just
started is full of coal, and if worked with method I should say
worth any amount of money. The tribes in the hills are the most
extraordinary thing in the world: they know no law, and obey no
master but the chief of their tribe. Every man is armed with a rifle,
and a modern one at that. Their villages are in such places that
only a goat can get at them, so they can laugh at the whole world
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
in general. The chief I had lunch with is a well-known brigand who
robs everybody who passes anywhere near him.</p>

<p>“I had rather a funny complaint last night: A man came round
most beautifully dressed, started off with a long-winded speech
about the British and how just they were, &amp;c., ending up by
saying that the headman’s servants had found his wife in the
bazaar and soundly beaten her, and did the British allow that sort
of thing?”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="caption"><i>The Thirteenth Hussars’ Charge at Hadraniyah,
by an Eye-Witness.</i></p>

<p>“It can be given to few to watch from a vantage-point, in near
vicinity, a spirited cavalry charge. All cavalrymen live for the
day when they may take part in this most exhilarating of all the
movements of war, and next to being a participator is the privilege
of seeing a charge take place.</p>

<p>“At midday on October 29th, 1918, the situation near Hadraniyah
was critical&mdash;to the south, Cassels’ Brigade was still engaged
delaying the retreat of Haqui Bey’s Army; linked with him 2&frac12;
miles to the north, Norton’s Brigade had, since dawn, been opposing
the advance of the reinforcements that were hurrying to the
Turkish Commander’s assistance.</p>

<p>“Almost due west of Hadraniyah Ford, in crossing which at
nightfall on the 28th the Brigade had lost twenty men drowned,
stands ‘Richardson’s Bluff.’ This Bluff is the culminating point
of the ridge which forms the old bank of the Tigris; it lies some
2000 yards from the present river bank, and rises almost precipitously
from the plain to the height of some 150 feet. Just to the
south of the Bluff there is a re-entrant in the ridge, sweeping
round which the latter continues to the south, at first at a lower
elevation, but gradually rising till it reaches Huwaish Gorge, along
the edge of which was Cassels’ position. The plain between the
Bluff and the river is as flat as the palm of the hand, save for
two mounds to the south and south-east, on the nearer of which,
some 900 yards distant, is a Mahommedan cemetery. At dawn
the reconnoitring squadron of the 13th Lancers had been driven
back by gun and machine-gun fire from the Bluff, and had taken
cover on Cemetery Hill.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span></p>

<p>“At 8.15 <small>A.M.</small> the Thirteenth Hussars had endeavoured to gallop
the Bluff, but owing to the leading Squadron Commander, Captain
Evans, having fallen severely wounded, his squadron had lost
direction and, inclining to the left, had arrived at Cemetery Hill
and relieved the squadron of the 13th Lancers, and there it was
joined by the remainder of the Regiment.</p>

<p>“Shortly after this the left was prolonged by the 14th Lancers,
who were disposed so as to intercept a junction between the enemy
that were opposing the 7th Brigade and those that were engaged
with Cassels.</p>

<p>“In support, in rear of the centre of our position, the 13th
Lancers were placed, while on the farther bank of the river, 3000
yards to the east, was V Battery, R.H.A., in action against
the enemy guns. At 10 <small>A.M.</small>, having forded the river, 337 A
Battery, R.F.A., came into action in our support, from about 2000
yards to the south of Cemetery Hill. The combined fire of the
two batteries soon silenced the enemy guns, and General Norton,
realising that the Bluff was the vital point, decided to make a
further attempt to wrest it from the enemy.</p>

<p>“It was evident by this time that the hostile force on the Bluff
was considerably stronger than had been previously reported. Our
position on the lower ground was very precarious, and a successful
decisive attack by the Turks would have driven us into the open,
rolled up Cassels’ flank, and taken him in the rear. The terrain prevented
an accurate reconnaissance of the enemy’s position being made.
It remained for General Norton to take the responsibility of ordering
a direct attack to be made on the Bluff, supported by the guns.</p>

<p>“Orders were issued, the Thirteenth Hussars concentrated on
their right, while both batteries heavily shelled the enemy’s position.</p>

<p>“The concentration of the Thirteenth Hussars was evidently seen
by the enemy, and occasioned a heavy outburst of fire, which revealed
the fact that they were in possession of more machine-guns
than up to then had been calculated. In consequence of this General
Norton ordered the attack to be postponed while further artillery
preparation took place.</p>

<p>“At 12.45 <small>P.M.</small> the General decided that further delay would be
dangerous, and that the effort must be made. Our helio winked a
message to the batteries that the Thirteenth Hussars were to attack
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
at 1.20 <small>P.M.</small>; and that they were to increase their rates of fire.
Both batteries redoubled their efforts&mdash;admirably directed by
Lt. Sutton (V Battery, R.H.A.), both ranging and fuses being
beautifully accurate; they plastered the Bluff with H.E. and shrapnel.
A slight delay in the arrangements made it impossible for the attack
to take place till 1.30 <small>P.M.</small> In the interval the Thirteenth Hussars
quietly formed up in column of wings under cover of Cemetery Hill.</p>

<p>“As the zero time approached urgent messages came from Major
Greenshields, commanding V Battery, that his ammunition was
running low. It was an anxious moment: on the crest of Cemetery
Hill the Brigade Headquarters Staff lay, taking what cover they
could behind the gravestones&mdash;down below the Hussars were quietly
falling in, resolute but serious, as all knew that much depended on
the coming assault, while its result was in the hands of the gods&mdash;on
our left the 13th and 14th Lancers were ready to ‘Mount’ and
‘Pursue,’ if the attack was successful, or extricate their comrades
if it was a reverse.</p>

<p>“On the Bluff was a veritable inferno&mdash;the H.E. bursting in black
clouds, the shrapnel in fleece-like puffs, both hurling death on the
doomed Turks&mdash;one continuous and awful roar swept the threatened
area.</p>

<p>“Deafened by the noise and rendered dizzy by the concussion,
Turks in the advanced trenches on the crest of the hill could be seen
getting up and running in a drunken manner to the rear; some caught
by bullets while <i>en route</i>, fell; others disappeared in the burst of an
H.E. shell, and nothing remained when the black cloud cleared away.</p>

<p>“And then the Hussars advanced; it was a glorious sight&mdash;the
first line led by their gallant Colonel, in perfect order, as if one on
a drill parade, swept round the edge of Cemetery Hill&mdash;the pace
increased&mdash;on they went with a loud inspiring cheer. Then equally
steady followed the second line.</p>

<p>“The enemy’s machine-guns rattled furiously&mdash;ours replied
viciously&mdash;on, on went the Hussars&mdash;then to our horror we saw
a check, and we realised that, straight across the front of the
Hussars, between them and the Bluff, ran a nullah.</p>

<p>“What is going to happen? Is it too wide? Can they cross it?
Another Omdurman or Shabkadr? were among the agonising thoughts
that flashed through our minds.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span></p>

<p>“A little crowding&mdash;a horse down&mdash;then a cheer rose to our lips
as we saw the Colonel thread his way across, and then, on his heels,
scrambling, hustling, thrusting, scarcely checking, the first line crossed
and went on.</p>

<p>“By this time the onlookers on the Cemetery Hill were mad with
excitement, and quite oblivious of the bullets still whistling over
them, they were standing up wildly cheering on the gallant Hussars.
Now they had reached the foot of the Bluff&mdash;so close was it to us
that we could distinguish individuals.</p>

<p>“Off they get&mdash;fix bayonets&mdash;up the hill they scrambled, with their
Colonel still at their head; the barrage lifts beautifully in time&mdash;and
the Hussars clear the crest and, spreading like a fan, on they go.
A machine-gun is rushed&mdash;then a Hussar was seen to fall&mdash;bayonet
work begins....</p>

<p>“‘By God, they are counter-attacking!’ bursts from the Brigade
Major’s lips, as a party of Turks drive back a troop of the Hussars;
but, steady as rocks, the Hussars meet the new attack&mdash;a few
shots, and then the bayonet. On our left there is a thunder of hoofs&mdash;a
host of lance-pennons dotted o’er the countryside shows the
13th and 14th Lancers are hurrying forward in support, lance in
rest ready for the pursuit. This is the final act in the drama, and
then all sobriety is forgotten; our helmets fly in the air as we cheer
and cheer again, as on all sides white flags of surrender are raised
by the defeated Turks.</p>

<p>“From every direction, in a few minutes, small bodies of the
enemy, marshalled by the gallant Hussars, can be seen marching in&mdash;and
the affair was over.</p>

<p>“It was with a choke in the throat that, a few minutes later, we
shook hands with the gallant ‘Jimmy,’ and congratulated him on
his splendid success, and ourselves on having been privileged to
watch and in some way partake of it.”</p>

<p class="caption"><i>Transport fording the Tigris, 1918. Major A. Cooke, Q.M.</i></p>

<p>“On October 31st, the transport, which had been left at Huwaish
on the left bank of the river Tigris, received orders to march at
6 <small>A.M.</small> and join the Brigade at Quayirah.</p>

<p>“After marching about 4 miles the ford was reached&mdash;apparently
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
the one described in Lieutenant-General Sir W. R. Marshall’s
despatch of 11th April 1919, by which the 11th Cavalry Brigade,
under Br.-General R. A. Cassels, C.B., D.S.O., had crossed.</p>

<p>“Two channels of the river had to be crossed before reaching the
main stream. Entering the latter, the ford followed a narrow ledge
in mid-river (the water here was about 4&frac12; feet deep) which ran for
a distance of about 500 yards up-stream; it then turned to the left
through fairly shallow water to the right bank. To the right of the
ledge the water was at least 5&frac12; feet deep, to the left flowed the rapid
and deep main stream of the Tigris.</p>

<p>“If a vehicle got off the ledge into the deeper water on the right,
it was extremely difficult to get the animals to start again; but if
they got off to the left there was little or no hope of recovery.</p>

<p>“The crossing was commenced, taking about 15 yards interval
between vehicles. Soon there came a check; the animals of one
waggon, tired of pulling against the rush of ice-cold water, came to
a standstill. The next waggon tried to pass to the right, but got
into the deeper water, and stayed there until extra animals could
be hitched in&mdash;this, in itself, proving a most difficult task.</p>

<p>“The column was again got moving, but several similar stops
occurred, until a limbered waggon and a water-cart of the 14th
Lancers got off the ledge to the left and were lost, two of the four
drivers and all the mules being drowned.</p>

<p>“All the transport of the Regiment, except the mess-carts, crossed
without trouble; these, being very light, had great difficulty in
stemming the swift current, and one was carried off the ledge and
swept down-stream.</p>

<p>“The driver of this cart was Pte. Harding, a good old soldier
who was mentioned in despatches during the South African War
for great gallantry (‘Regimental History,’ volume ii. pp. 129 and
207). He was accompanied in the cart by an Indian cook.</p>

<p>“Every one who saw them carried away thought they were certainly
lost. Harding, however, kept his head, and, whilst being floated
down the river at a great pace, sat and handled his reins as though
he were driving along a hard road. The horse swam with the
stream, the well-laden cart floated evenly on the water, and the
whole lot went down-stream for about 800 yards before coming
to a standstill. While in deep water, Harding gradually steered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
towards the bank, and at length guided the horse to where he could
just scrape his feet along the shingly bottom, and come to a halt,
standing.</p>

<p>“The horse was dead-beat, and it was feared that they would again
be carried away by the rush of water, when an Indian Artillery
driver rode into the river and reached the cart-horse’s head. By
seizing the rein and assisting and encouraging the horse, he
eventually got it to shallower water, where aid was forthcoming to
get the cart ashore.</p>

<p>“It was a most daring and gallant feat on the part of the Indian
driver, and his conduct was brought to the notice of the Army
Commander. Private Harding received the cheers and congratulations
of all assembled there, and was recommended for a reward.</p>

<p>“This may not appear very exciting in print, but when it is
remembered that the Tigris is about 300 yards wide, with such a
volume of water rushing down that no communication by shouting
is possible, except at very short distances, and that men and animals
were struggling and drowning at the time, the writer thinks that
all who read this account will agree that fording the Tigris with
the transport afforded not the least of the many thrilling incidents
of the closing days of the war.”

<span class="large">SCOPE AND MEANING OF THE MESOPOTAMIAN CAMPAIGN.
THE SHARE IN IT OF THE THIRTEENTH HUSSARS.</span></h2>

<p>The bearing of the campaign in Mesopotamia upon the issues of
the Great War has already been examined in the course of the
narrative; but at the risk of some repetition it seems desirable to
sum up here the achievements of the British in this part of the
world, and to see what effect they had upon the general situation.</p>

<p>No one was in a better position to give a correct view of the
subject in a few words than the Commander who had the thoroughly
deserved good fortune to complete the overthrow of the Turks and
the conquest of the country. General Marshall, in his despatch
of the 1st February 1919, writes as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The campaign in Mesopotamia has lasted just four years.
From small beginnings, when Fort Fao was captured on November
6th, 1914, the ration strength of the force when Mosul was occupied
had grown to some 420,000, including labour battalions.</p>

<p>“The area of territory of the Turkish Empire which has been
conquered and occupied amounts to 114,000 square miles. The
sphere of operations has included Trans-Caucasia and Trans-Caspia,
and detachments furnished by the force are being employed over
territory extending from Deir-as-Zor on the Euphrates, 330 miles
north-west of Baghdad, to Merv in Trans-Caspia, some 1450 miles
north-east of Baghdad.</p>

<p>“Actual captures since the beginning of the campaign amount to
45,500 prisoners and 250 guns, together with vast quantities of war
material of all descriptions.</p>

<p>“These results have been achieved in a country destitute of shade
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
in summer, and impassable owing to floods in wet weather, and
are a lasting record of the gallantry and endurance of the officers
and men, both British and Indian, who have fought uncomplainingly
in spite of heat, thirst, rain, and discomfort, for four years in
Mesopotamia.”</p>

<p>This no doubt is a true and in some respects a striking presentment
of the case; but it is a modest one, and more might have
been said without exaggeration.</p>

<p>Mention has been made in earlier chapters of the scheme of
world dominion conceived by the Germans, and of the part which
Turkey was to play in it. Germany aimed not only at becoming
the Paramount Power in Europe, but at the supreme control of the
East. The two things were parts, and equally important parts, of
the great conspiracy. They were, so to speak, the twin pillars upon
which the whole vast superstructure of German dominion was to
rest. For the Eastern part of the scheme Turkey was essential.
Upon the geographical situation and the military power of Turkey,
supported by German gold and German military science, supported
also by the Sultan’s influence as the spiritual head of Islam, everything
depended. Through their vassal Turkey, the Germans were
to strike down their most formidable enemy&mdash;England, whose fleet
stood between them and the dominion of the world. This is not
mere surmise. Germany made little secret of her intentions, or of
the means by which they were to be fulfilled.</p>

<p>When Turkey proceeded to declare war against the Allies and
to carry out her part in the German scheme, she was very soon
able, after beating off an attack on the Dardanelles, to throw her
whole weight into Asia. From the nature of things her military
effort then resolved itself into an advance upon three fronts. On
her left she struck at the Russians in the Caucasus, in the centre
she struck at both Russians and English in Persia, and hoped to
work through Persia upon Afghanistan and India. On her right
she struck at England in Egypt. All these countries&mdash;the Caucasus,
Persia, Afghanistan, the Indian Frontier, Egypt&mdash;were mainly or
largely Mahomedan, and the Koran was to give weight to the blows
of the Turkish sword.</p>

<p>Before very long Russia broke up, and England stood practically
alone, so that in Western Asia it became a duel between her and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
Turkey. The struggle was fought out on all three of the Turkish
fronts, but mainly in the centre and on the Turkish right. On both
these fronts England, though dangerously weak at first, grew stronger
and stronger as time went on, until eventually she overwhelmed her
enemy. Instead of being attacked and beaten in Egypt, she advanced
from Egypt and crushed the Turkish armies in Palestine and Syria.
Instead of being attacked and beaten in Persia and India, she
advanced into Mesopotamia, and planted the British flag upon the
citadels of Baghdad and Mosul. Under these tremendous blows the
Turkish military power collapsed, and with it collapsed the Eastern
part of the German world-scheme. Perhaps more than this might
be said; for the fall of Turkey was no doubt a heavy shock and
discouragement to Turkey’s masters, struggling hard themselves to
carry out their conquest of Europe. But it is enough to know that
the British armies in Mesopotamia and Palestine brought Turkey
to her knees.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to inquire which of the two had the leading
share in this great feat of arms. They were portions of one Imperial
Army, and though fighting hundreds of miles apart, with a vast desert
between them, they were enabled, through England’s command of
the sea, to afford each other some support. The Mesopotamian
Army more than once sent large forces round by sea to join the
army in Palestine, and Allenby’s victories in Palestine reacted with
immense effect upon the situation in Mesopotamia. It was a signal
instance of the influence of sea power in war, for it did much to
neutralise the great advantage given to Turkey by her central position
against her widely-parted enemies. The two of them, striking
separately, yet in a sense together, from their common base, the
sea, overthrew and ruined her.</p>

<p>It was the same sea power that enabled England to make each
of them efficient in itself. Not only did the sea bring them their
hundreds of thousands of fighting men, but the sea brought them
everything needed to let their men fight with success. As to the
Mesopotamian campaign, it was, as its very name implies, a river
campaign, and the utilisation of the Turkish rivers, especially the
Tigris, was the first essential of success. Nothing was so remarkable
in all the history of the campaign as the way in which the Tigris was
broken in and transformed from an almost insuperable obstacle into
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
a great military highway. By a hard and sustained effort, impossible
for any nation but the mistress of the seas, the turbulent undisciplined
river was tamed and enlisted in the service of the invaders, and its
carrying power was increased nearly a thousandfold. When Maude
began his advance, its surface was swarming with steamboats that
had found their way, thanks to the daring and skill of British
seamen, from the Hughli and the Irawadi and the Thames, until
they were numerous enough to carry a large army into the heart of
the Turkish Empire, and to keep it supplied with all the multitudinous
necessities of modern war.</p>

<p>The river steamers were supported by rapidly constructed railways
and roads, and all manner of engineering works; new
irrigation channels were made or ancient channels reopened;
many of the wild Arab tribes were gradually brought to see the
advantages of order and service; crops were raised and gathered;
altogether the activities of our people were innumerable, and the
conquest of a country almost as large as the United Kingdom went
hand-in-hand with the measures necessary for making it prosperous
and contented.</p>

<p>What its future will be no one can say. To take over such a
country, with its turbulent population and unsettled frontiers and
outlying responsibilities of many kinds, is a formidable task; but
in any case the conquest of it, from such an enemy as the Turk,
was no small contribution to the work done by the British Empire
in the Great War. It was performed at a distance from England,
among scenes unfamiliar to Englishmen, and, partly owing to Press
restrictions, it did not greatly appeal to the country’s attention,
which was naturally enough fixed upon the progress of the conflict
in Europe; but it was none the less a great achievement, and one
of which all concerned in it may well be proud.</p>

<p>Among those concerned in it was the Regiment whose history
forms the subject of this book, and there remains to be considered
now the part which the Regiment played in the campaign.</p>

<p>The Thirteenth were perhaps fortunate in that they did not
come to Mesopotamia until 1916, when the first half, and the most
trying half, of the Mesopotamian Campaign was over. They had
no part in the earlier fighting, when the British force was small
and ill-found, and its difficulties great. They were spared the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
troubles and sufferings endured by the troops who conquered the
lower part of the country; they did not march up with Townshend
to the bloody field of Ctesiphon, or share in the desperate efforts to
break through to his relief when he was shut up in Kut. When
they landed at Basra all that was over. Horrified at the losses and
sufferings entailed by its attempt&mdash;one of its customary attempts&mdash;to
make a small force do the work of a large one, the nation had
suddenly woken up to the needs of Mesopotamia; and, blaming
every one but those chiefly to blame, itself and its statesmen, was
now pouring in without stint Regiments and guns and river
steamers and every kind of war material. It could not bring back
to life the thousands of men sacrificed, or undo the injustice done
to some of its best soldiers, but it was determined that the Mesopotamian
force should for the future fight with reasonable chances
of success; and though its attention was soon diverted again, it
certainly made a fine effort, the result of which was to endure.
The Thirteenth came in on the turn of the tide, and though they
had before them two years of hard work and hard fighting, they
were never to know the bitterness of defeat.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the work was severe, and the issue of the fighting
was often doubtful for a time. That it uniformly ended in success,
and eventually in complete triumph, was proof of very high qualities
in the men who led and the men who followed. For the Turk is
a stubborn enemy. He was once acknowledged, by general consent,
as the best soldier in Europe; and if time has deprived him
of some of his reputation, it still stands deservedly high.</p>

<p>As in the Palestine campaign, so in Mesopotamia, the Cavalry
found its chance. There, as in all modern war, it was no doubt
the Infantry and guns which mainly decided the fate of battles;
but the Cavalry had much to do for the armies both before and
after battle, in reconnaissance, in sweeping the country for supplies,
in pursuit, and in the turning movements which at times brought
about the enemy’s ruin. Even in the actual shock of battle they
were not wholly excluded from a share of fighting and honour. Some
tributes to the value of their services in Mesopotamia have already
been recorded in earlier chapters. There is one service which perhaps
has not been sufficiently brought out. The whole plan of General
Maude’s attack upon the Turkish army which faced him on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
north bank of the Tigris, when he began his advance in December
1916, was to push up the south bank, and keep threatening their
rear from that side until they had so extended the line held by their
troops that they were no longer strong enough to hold it all securely&mdash;to
prevent his forcing a passage at some point and getting in behind
their main body. As he put it in a letter to General Symons: “The
Turks were very sticky and would not go for a long time, but we
gradually stretched them and stretched them till owing to their
casualties they were much weakened, and then we struck boldly at
their tail across the Tigris. I had been hammering at this for two
months, and the fact that they would not give up Sannaiyat, and
consequently placed themselves in the dangerous position of having
a line of communication in prolongation of their battle front, was
their undoing.”</p>

<p>And the Cavalry had much to do with this stretching process. In
his despatch giving an account of the whole advance to Baghdad,
General Maude writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The work of the Cavalry had been difficult. The flat terrain
intersected with nalas obstructed movement without providing cover,
and the state of the country after heavy rains made progress even
for short distances laborious. The absence of water, too, away from
the river, limited its radius of action. Nevertheless its reconnaissance
work and the blows delivered against the enemy’s communications
helped in no small way to bring about that dissipation of his forces
which was so essential to our success, and the pressure applied after
the passage of the Tigris to the retreating enemy was instrumental
in completing his final rout.”</p>

<p>The Thirteenth, working from their camp on the Hai river, did
their full share of the Cavalry work so described.</p>

<p>During the subsequent march on Baghdad, to quote again
General Maude’s letter to General Symons: “Your old Regiment
did splendidly,” and in the course of it, at Lajj, they had their
first chance, while pressing the pursuit, of delivering a real Cavalry
charge, mounted and sword in hand.</p>

<p>This charge, “a brilliant charge,” as General Maude called it,
was the first of several which have been described in earlier chapters.
At Tekrit, at Kulawand, and at Tuz Kermatli the Regiment got in
with the sword; and if the final onslaught at Hadraniya was made
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
on foot with the bayonet, it was none the less a hand-to-hand attack,
after a gallop across the open to the foot of the bluff on which were
the Turkish trenches. Nor is an assault with the bayonet less
creditable than a mounted charge. Naturally a Cavalry Regiment will
always long for that, and rejoice in it if it comes; but, as many
leading soldiers have now recognised, Cavalry under present
conditions, to be thoroughly efficient, must be able to fight on foot
as well as on horseback. Ever since the American Civil War this
has become clearer and clearer. The Thirteenth in Mesopotamia,
as other Cavalry Regiments in this war, have in a measure reverted
to their old r&ocirc;le as Dragoons, to whom the firearm of the Infantry
is as familiar as the sword.</p>

<p>Far from lessening the honour due to them, the fact that both
at Lajj and at Hadraniya the Thirteenth showed they could fight
either way, is very much to their credit. There was no lack of the
Cavalry spirit. Their whole inclination was to charge on horseback,
sword in hand. But, if necessary, they could do something more.</p>

<p>To conclude, perhaps the most valuable singly of all the services
rendered by the Cavalry during the campaign, was the one of which
the Hadraniya charge was only a part&mdash;namely, the long march round
into the enemy’s rear and the closing of his line of retreat, which led
to the surrender of his whole force. The credit of this daring feat
is due in the first place to Cassels and his own 11th Brigade, but
the 7th Brigade too deserved much credit, for it may be doubted
whether without their timely help Cassels and his men could have
held their own against the repeated and desperate attacks of an
enemy so superior in numbers.</p>

<p>Altogether, the Thirteenth Hussars did their duty well from the
beginning to the end of their stay in Mesopotamia, which lasted for
two years and a half. During that time they gained much honour
at a heavy cost. Of their officers, eight were killed in action or died
on service, two were disabled and taken prisoners, and fourteen were
wounded. In other ranks the numbers were 90, 2, and 176. It is
an honourable record.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.<br />

<span class="large">RETURN TO ENGLAND&mdash;CONCLUSION.</span></h2>

<p>The Thirteenth remained in and about Mosul throughout the months
of November and December 1918; but early in January 1919
they were ordered to return to Baghdad, and marching on the 11th
of the month, arrived in Baghdad on the 29th.</p>

<p>There they remained in camp for some weeks, when the welcome
order was received to embark for England. On the 10th March,
the Regiment went on board a river steamer, and started on
their journey down the Tigris. It was a large vessel, and with
them were their old comrades of the Fourteenth Hussars. Trans-shipping
at Basra to the <i>Etna</i>, and at Bombay to the <i>City of Sparta</i>,
they arrived on the 29th April in the Mersey, and on the following
day went ashore at Liverpool. On the 5th May they marched
into the Cavalry Barracks at Aldershot, where they were to be
quartered.</p>

<p>Here this History of ‘The Thirteenth Hussars in the Great War’
naturally comes to an end, for though the war was not formally
concluded, the Regiment was now in England again, and its share
in the military operations was over.</p>

<p>But so much has been written and spoken during the last few
years regarding the value of Cavalry in modern war that, as remarked
in the introductory chapter, it seems desirable, before leaving the
subject of the services performed by the Regiment, to say a few
words upon this question. It is one about which professional
soldiers only can have an opinion of any value, and I therefore
confine myself to quoting the opinion of professional soldiers.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span></p>

<p class="caption">ON THE WAY HOME<br />

<small>THE “CITY OF SPARTA” PASSING A JAPANESE DESTROYER IN THE SUEZ CANAL</small></p></div>

<p>The authorities whose views have been most definitely stated
are Lord Haig, Lord Allenby, and the two Generals who commanded
in Mesopotamia, Maude and Marshall.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> The last two have
been already quoted as to the Cavalry work in the advance to
Baghdad, and beyond. General Allenby has written as follows
regarding the operations in Palestine:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The Desert Mounted Corps took some 46,000 prisoners during
the operations. The complete destruction of the VIIth and VIIIth
Turkish armies depended mainly on the rapidity with which their
communications were reached, and on quick decision in dealing with
the enemy’s columns as they attempted to escape. The vigorous
handling of the Cavalry by its leaders, and the rapidity of its movement,
overcame all attempts to delay its progress. The enemy’s
columns, after they had out-distanced the pursuing Infantry, were
given no time to reorganise and fight their way through.”</p>

<p>Of course, the Cavalry did not effect their work alone. General
Allenby says that the breaking of the enemy’s entrenched lines by
the Infantry enabled the Cavalry to accomplish its mission. But
this is no detraction from the merit of either. Both arms did their
duty, and the result, in Palestine as in Mesopotamia, was what
Henderson calls the most important operation of grand tactics&mdash;the
surrounding and destruction of an enemy’s army.</p>

<p>General Haig is perhaps the most important witness of all, not
only because of the greatness of his command, but because the
Western Front, with its immense system of trenches, stretching
from end to end of the theatre of war, was the one where Cavalry
was at special disadvantage. In his final despatch, summing up
the features of the war, he deliberately takes up the question, and
gives his answer. I quote the following words:&mdash;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="caption">“<i>The Value of Cavalry in Modern War.</i></p>

<p>“17. From time to time, as the war of position dragged on,
and the enemy’s trench systems remained unbroken, while questions
of man-power and the shortage of shipping became acute, the wisdom
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
or necessity of maintaining any large force of mounted men was
freely discussed. In the light of the full experience of the War, the
decision to preserve the Cavalry Corps has been fully justified. It
has been proved that Cavalry, whether used for shock effect under
suitable conditions, or as mobile Infantry, have still an indispensable
part to play in modern war. Moreover, it cannot safely be assumed
that in all future wars, the flanks of the opposing forces will rest
on neutral states or impassable obstacles. Whenever such a condition
does not obtain, opportunities for the use of Cavalry must
arise frequently.”</p>

<p>General Haig proceeds to justify his opinion by examples, and
concludes with a reference to the position of the British Cavalry
on the morning of the Armistice which closed the war. “There is
no doubt that, had the advance of the Cavalry been allowed to
continue, the enemy’s disorganised retreat would have been turned
into a rout.” In fact, the Armistice deprived the British Cavalry
of the certainty of striking, in the last and greatest of all wars
hitherto fought, and in that theatre of the war where they were at
special disadvantage, the most stupendous blow ever struck by a
body of armed horsemen since the history of the world began.</p>

<p>The British Cavalry consisted of Regiments similar to the
Thirteenth Hussars. The story of such a Regiment is not therefore,
as some think, the story of one unit of an arm which is now useless
in war&mdash;as useless, it has been said, as bows and arrows. On the contrary,
Cavalry has proved its usefulness up till now, and we may be
sure that in the near future at all events, whether used on horseback
for battle-shock, or as mobile Infantry, or in any other way of
duty, it will still do good service to its country, as it has done in

people so long as war endures in the world, nor is there any reason
to fear that we shall soon see the last of the famous squadrons in
which that spirit is so gloriously embodied.</p>

<p>But the souls of the righteous are in the hand of God, and there shall no
torment touch them. In the sight of the unwise they seemed to die; and
their departure is taken for misery, and their going from us to be utter
destruction: but they are in peace. For though they be punished in the
sight of men, yet is their hope full of immortality. And having been a little
chastised, they shall be greatly rewarded; for God proved them and found
them worthy for Himself. As gold in the furnace hath He tried them, and
received them as a burnt-offering.</p>

<p>Almighty God, with whom do live the spirits of them that depart hence
in the Lord, and with whom the souls of the faithful, after they are delivered
from the burden of the flesh, are in joy and felicity; We give Thee hearty
thanks, for that it hath pleased Thee to take our brethren into Thy merciful
keeping: beseeching Thee that we, with all those that are departed in the
true faith of Thy Holy Name, may have our perfect consummation and bliss,
both in body and soul, in Thy eternal and everlasting glory; through Jesus
Christ our Lord. <span class="smcap">Amen.</span></p>

<p>Almighty God, we commend to Thy loving kindness the souls of Thy
servants, the men of this Regiment, whom we now commemorate before Thee.
Accept, O Lord, the offering of their self-sacrifice, and grant to them with
all Thy faithful servants a place of refreshment and peace where the light of
Thy countenance shines for ever, and where all tears are wiped away; through
Jesus Christ our Lord. <span class="smcap">Amen.</span></p>

<p>Comfort, O Lord, we pray Thee, all who are mourning the loss of those
near and dear to them. Be with them in their sorrow. Support them with
the knowledge of Thy love. Teach them to rest and lean on Thee. Give
them faith to look beyond the troubles of this present time, and to know that

Jesus our Lord, to whom with the Father and the Holy Ghost be all honour

<p>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,
we dedicate this Memorial to the glory of God, and in memory of the Men
of this Regiment who have fallen in the great War. May their example
inspire us to courage in the greater war against all evil. May their memory
ever burn brightly in those who here or elsewhere remember their deeds,
and, strengthened by their fellowship, look forward to reunion with them
in the inheritance of the saints in light.</p>

<p>We give Thee thanks, O Lord, Father Almighty, for all those Thy servants
who waxed valiant in fight and wrought righteousness, and counting not their
life dear unto themselves, laid it down for their friends; and we pray Thee
that, having fought a good fight and finished their course with joy, they may
rejoice evermore with them that have come out of great tribulation, and,
having washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb,
stand before Thy Throne and serve Thee day and night for ever; through
Him that overcame and is set down on Thy Throne, Jesus Christ our Lord,
who liveth and reigneth with Thee and the Holy Ghost now and ever and
world without end. <span class="smcap">Amen.</span></p>

Thee with constancy on earth, we may be joined hereafter with Thy blessed

<h3>Thirteenth Hussars Old Comrades Association.</h3>

<p>This Association&mdash;originally called the “Old Comrades Dinner Club”&mdash;was
formed in accordance with a suggestion made at a meeting held at the
Office of the 13th Hussars Association, on Saturday, 1st March 1913, under
the Presidency of Lieut.-Colonel E. A. Wiggin, when a large number of past
and present officers of the Regiment were present, also a good number of
late N.C.O.’s and men. A committee was formed, and it was decided to
start a Club of Old Comrades of the Regiment under the title of “The
Old Comrades Dinner Club,” for the purpose of holding an Annual Dinner.</p>

<p>The Annual Dinner is held on the fourth Saturday in October.</p>

<p>All retired officers, non-commissioned officers, and men whose addresses
are known have been invited to enrol themselves as members.</p>

<p>Men of the Regiment of good character on taking their discharge are
eligible for election, and are requested to send their names and addresses to
the Hon. Secretary.</p>

<p>The Annual Subscription is 2s. 6d.</p>

<p>Invitations to the dinner are sent to members and (amongst others) to
all Chelsea Pensioners of the Regiment who come as guests of the Association.</p>

<p>The Association has been the means of assisting many past members of
the Regiment to obtain employment, and is very largely resorted to by men
in need of help and advice.</p>

<p>Donations and subscriptions to the funds of the Association should be
sent to the Hon. Secretary, from whom all particulars as to membership and
otherwise can be obtained.</p>

It may be noted that Hannibal’s invasion of Italy led, two thousand years later, to the
recognition of the influence of sea power on history. Admiral Mahan himself described to
the writer how it one day occurred to him that Hannibal’s long march from Spain to Italy had
been necessitated by the Roman strength at sea, and that this was the underlying cause of his
eventual ruin. Following up the train of thought, Mahan gradually worked out his great
conception. Hannibal’s march was the germ from which it sprang.</p></div>

As to the value of its work in Europe opinions differed. Some seemed to think little of
it. Some declared that during the time when English reinforcements were not yet ready to
go into line, the Indian contingent had saved the British Army from being overwhelmed. Both
these views were perhaps extreme. The Indian soldier fought under serious disadvantage in
the climate and surroundings of Europe, but undoubtedly he fought with great devotion and
suffered heavy losses, for which England owes him deep gratitude. The matter may well be
allowed to rest there.</p></div>

In 1854, when the Regiment went to the Russian War, it is recorded that on one of the
transports “the beef had made several voyages to and from India, and then been returned into
store. Some barrels of peas even bore the date 1828 plainly painted thereon. It was impossible
to boil them&mdash;also the pork (salt) was as aged as the salt beef, and as bad.” The <i>Islanda</i> was
better than this.</p></div>

Captain Eve, the senior Captain, was then second in command of the Regiment, owing
to the absence of Major Twist, disabled, and on the particular day, as Colonel Richardson
was on other duty, Eve had taken the Regiment into action. Captain Steele was next in
seniority.</p></div>

The man was Private T. O’Connor. In a letter from Mesopotamia to Mr Justice Eve he
writes: “I was the last ammunition-carrier to get wounded that day, and your son and Captain
Steele came out under heavy machine-gun fire and carried me in as we evacuated that position
that night, thus saving me from being taken prisoner. There is no need to tell you he was
loved in the squadron, as we have missed him as one of the finest soldiers and leaders of men
any soldier could wish to follow.”</p></div>

It may be well to note here that in the course of this campaign, where the Tigris was
the main line of communication, the distances were usually calculated by river. The distances
by road, when a road existed, were much shorter, roughly perhaps half the river distances.</p></div>

It may possibly be argued that both Lord Haig and Lord Allenby were Cavalry officers,
and therefore perhaps inclined to think highly of the achievements of their own arm. They
certainly were Cavalry officers, as was Lord French, a fact well worthy of note, but, like
him, they were something more&mdash;great leaders of armies.</p></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
